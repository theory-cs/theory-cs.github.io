\newcommand{\instructions}{{\bf For all HW assignments:}

Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. 
You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. 
The lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. 
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your homework submission.

All submitted homework for this class must be typed. 
Diagrams may be hand-drawn and scanned and included in the typed document. 
You can use a word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) 
but you might find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. 
LaTeX is a markup language used widely in computer science and mathematics. 
The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX and you can use the source files 
as templates for typesetting your solutions\footnote{To use this template, copy the source file (extension \texttt{.tex}) 
to your working directory or upload to Overleaf.}.


{\bf Integrity reminders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the partners. The homework is
designed to give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, 
while getting to know and learn from your classmates.
\item You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your group members.
You may ask questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and 
on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the Instructors).  
You \emph{cannot} use any online resources about the course content other than the class material 
from this quarter -- this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and
definitions we will use this quarter.
\item Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with 
other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning 
experience and detract from their success in the class.
\end{itemize}
