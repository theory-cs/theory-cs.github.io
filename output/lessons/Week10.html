<p><span><em>Recall:</em></span></p>
<p>A relation is an <span><strong>equivalence relation</strong></span> means it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</p>
<p>An <span><strong>equivalence class</strong></span> of an element <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> with respect to an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> on the set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the set <span class="math display">\[\{s \in A | (a, s) \in R \}\]</span> We write <span class="math inline">\([a]_R\)</span> for this set, which is the equivalence class of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>A <span><strong>partition</strong></span> of a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a set of non-empty, disjoint subsets <span class="math inline">\(A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \{ x \mid \exists i (x \in A_i) \}\]</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Claim</strong></span>: For each <span class="math inline">\(a \in U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\([a]_{E}  \neq  \emptyset\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: Towards a <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span> consider an arbitrary element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. We will work to show that <span class="math inline">\([a]_E \neq \emptyset\)</span>, namely that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x \in [a]_E\)</span>. By definition of equivalence classes, we can rewrite this goal as <span class="math display">\[\exists x \in U ~( ~(a,x) \in E~)\]</span> Towards a <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span>, consider <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span>, an element of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> by definition. By <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\((a,a) \in E\)</span> and thus the existential quantification has been proved.<br />
<span><strong>Claim</strong></span>: For each <span class="math inline">\(a \in U\)</span>, there is some <span class="math inline">\(b \in U\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a \in [b]_{E}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Towards a <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span> consider an arbitrary element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. By definition of equivalence classes, we can rewrite the goal as <span class="math display">\[\exists b \in U ~( ~(b,a) \in E~)\]</span> Towards a <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span>, consider <span class="math inline">\(b = a\)</span>, an element of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> by definition. By <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\((a,a) \in E\)</span> and thus the existential quantification has been proved.<br />
<span><strong>Claim</strong></span>: For each <span class="math inline">\(a,b  \in U\)</span> , <span class="math inline">\((~(a,b)  \in  E ~\to ~ [a]_{E}  = [b]_{E}~)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((~(a,b)  \notin  E ~\to ~ [a]_{E} \cap[b]_{E} = \emptyset~)\)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Corollary</strong></span>: Given an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> on set <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{ [x]_{E} \mid x \in U  \}\)</span> is a partition of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</p>
<p>Last time, we saw that partitions associated to equivalence relations were useful in the context of modular arithmetic. Today we’ll look at a different application.</p>
<p>Recall that in a movie recommendation system, each user’s ratings of movies is represented as a <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple (with the positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> being the number of movies in the database), and each component of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuple is an element of the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{-1,0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We call <span class="math inline">\(Rt_5\)</span> the set of all ratings <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuples.</p>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(d: Rt_5 \times Rt_5 \to \mathbb{N}\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[d (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5) ~) ~) = \sum_{i=1}^5 |x_i - y_i|\]</span></p>
<p>Consider the following binary relations on <span class="math inline">\(Rt_5\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[E_{proj} =  \{ ( ~(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5)~) \in
         Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~(x_1 = y_1) \land  (x_2 = y_2) \land (x_3 = y_3) \}\]</span></p>
<p>Example ordered pair in <span class="math inline">\(E_{proj}\)</span>:</p>
<p>Reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? Antisymmetric?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_{dist} =  \{ (u,v) \in Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~ d( u,v ) \leq 2 \}\]</span> Example ordered pair in <span class="math inline">\(E_{dist}\)</span>:</p>
<p>Reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? Antisymmetric?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_{circ} =  \{ (u,v) \in Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~ d(~ ( ~(0,0,0,0,0)~, u)~ ) =  d( ~(~(0,0,0,0,0),v~)~) \}\]</span> Example ordered pair in <span class="math inline">\(E_{circ}\)</span>:</p>
<p>Reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive? Antisymmetric?</p>
<p>The partition of <span class="math inline">\(Rt_5\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(\underline{\phantom{E_{proj}}}\)</span> is</p>
<p>The partition of <span class="math inline">\(Rt_5\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(E = \underline{\phantom{E_{circ}}}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{aligned}

    &amp;, [ ~(1,1,1,1,1)~ ] \\
    \qquad\}  &amp; \\
\end{aligned}\)</span></p>
<p>How many elements are in each part of the partition?</p>

<p><span><strong>Scenario</strong></span>: Good morning! You’re a user experience engineer at Netflix. A product goal is to design customized home pages for groups of users who have similar interests. Your manager tasks you with designing an algorithm for producing a clustering of users based on their movie interests, so that customized homepages can be engineered for each group.</p>
<p><span><strong>Conventions for today</strong></span>: We will use <span class="math inline">\(U = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_t\}\)</span> to refer to an arbitrary set of user ratings (we’ll pick some specific examples to explore) that are a subset of <span class="math inline">\(Rt_5\)</span>. We will be interested in creating partitions <span class="math inline">\(C_1, \cdots, C_m\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. We’ll assume that each user represented by an element of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> has a unique ratings tuple.</p>
<p>Your idea: equivalence relations! You offer your manager three great options:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_{id} = \{ ( ~(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)~) \mid 
    (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) \in Rt_5  \}\]</span></p>
<p><span><em>Describe how each homepage should be designed …</em></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_{proj} =  \{ ( ~(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5)~) \in
         Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~(x_1 = y_1) \land  (x_2 = y_2) \land (x_3 = y_3) \}\]</span></p>
<p><span><em>Describe how each homepage should be designed …</em></span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E_{circ} =  \{ (u,v) \in Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~ d(~ ( ~(0,0,0,0,0)~, u)~ ) =  d( ~(~(0,0,0,0,0),v~)~) \}\]</span></p>
<p><span><em>Describe how each homepage should be designed …</em></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Scenario</strong></span>: Good morning! You’re a user experience engineer at Netflix. A product goal is to design customized home pages for groups of users who have similar interests. You task your team with designing an algorithm for producing a clustering of users based on their movie interests. Your team implements two algorithms that produce different clusterings. How do you decide which one to use? What feedback do you give the team in order to help them improve? Clearly, you will need to use math.</p>
<p>Your idea: find a way to <span><strong>score</strong></span> clusterings (partitions)</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: For a cluster of ratings <span class="math inline">\(C = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n \} 
\subseteq U\)</span>, the <span><strong>diameter</strong></span> of the cluster is defined by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\textit{diameter}(C) = \max_{1 \leq i, j \leq n} (d(~(r_i, r_j)~))\]</span></p>
<p>Consider <span class="math inline">\(x = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y = (1, 1, 1, 0, 1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z = (-1, -1, 0, 0, 0)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)\)</span>.</p>
<p>What is <span class="math inline">\(\textit{diameter}(\{x, y, z\})\)</span>? <span class="math inline">\(\textit{diameter}(\{x, y\})\)</span>? <span class="math inline">\(\textit{diameter}(\{x, z, w\})\)</span>?</p>
<p><em>diameter</em> works on single clusters. One way to aggregate across a clustering <span class="math inline">\(C_1, \cdots, C_m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{k=1}^m diameter(C_k)\)</span></p>
<p>Is this a good score?</p>
<p>How can we express the idea of <span><strong>many elements within a small area</strong></span>? Key idea: “give credit” to small diameter clusters with many elements.</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: For a cluster of ratings <span class="math inline">\(C = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n \} 
\subseteq U\)</span>, the <span><strong>density</strong></span> of the cluster is defined by: <span class="math display">\[\frac{n}{1+ diameter(C)}\]</span></p>
<p>Can you use density to decide whether the partition given by the equivalence classes of <span class="math inline">\(E_{proj}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(E_{circ}\)</span> for this task?</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="tips-for-future-classes-from-the-cse-20-tas-and-tutors">Tips for future classes from the CSE 20 TAs and tutors</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In class</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to class</p></li>
<li><p>Show up to class early because sometimes seats get taken/ the classroom gets full and then you have to sit on the floor</p></li>
<li><p>There’s usually a space for skateboards/longboards/eboards to go at the front or rear of the lecture hall</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a flask water bottle please ensure that its secured during a lecture and it cannot fall - putting on the floor often leads to it falling since people sometimes cross your seats.</p></li>
<li><p>Take notes - it’s much faster and more effective to note-take in class than watch recordings after, particularly if you do so longhand</p></li>
<li><p>Resist the urge to sit in the back. You will be able to focus much better sitting near the front, where there are fewer screens in front of you to distract from the lecture content</p></li>
<li><p>If you bring your laptop to class to take notes / access class materials, sit towards the back of the room to minimize distractions for people sitting behind you!</p></li>
<li><p>On zoom it’s easy to just type a question out in chat, it might be a little more awkward to do so in person, but it is definitely worth it. Don’t feel like you should already know what’s being covered</p></li>
<li><p>Always check you have your iclicker<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> on you. Just keep it in your backpack permanently. That way you can never forget it.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be afraid to talk to the people next to you during group discussions. Odds are they’re as nervous as you are, and you can all benefit from sharing your thoughts and understanding of the material</p></li>
<li><p>Certain classes will podcast the lectures, just like Zoom archives lecture recordings, at podcast.ucsd.edu</p></li>
<li><p>If they aren’t podcasted, and you want to record lectures, ask your professor for consent first</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Office hours, tutor hours, and the CSE building</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Office hours are a good place to hang out and get work done while being able to ask questions as they come up</p></li>
<li><p>Office hour attendance is typically much busier in person (and confined to the space in the room)</p></li>
<li><p>Get to know the CSE building: CSE B260, basement labs, office hours rooms</p></li>
<li><p>Know how to get in to the building after-hours</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Libraries and on-campus resources</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look up what library floors are for what, how to book rooms: East wing of Geisel is open 24/7 (they might ask to see an ID if you stay late), East Wing of Geisel has chess boards and jigsaw puzzles, study pods on the 8th floor, free computers/wifi</p></li>
<li><p>Know Biomed exists and is usually less crowded</p></li>
<li><p>Most libraries allow you to borrow whiteboards and markers (also laptops, tablets, microphones, and other cool stuff) for 24 hours</p></li>
<li><p>Take advantage of Dine with a prof / Coffee with a prof program. It’s legit free food / coffee once per quarter.</p></li>
<li><p>When planning out your daily schedule, think about where classes are, how much time will they take, are their places to eat nearby and how you can schedule social time with friends to nearby areas</p></li>
<li><p>Take into account the distances between classes if they are back to back</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Final exams</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are 8am finals? Basically in-person exams are different</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t forget your university card during exams</p></li>
<li><p>Blue books for exams (what they are, where to get them)</p></li>
<li><p>Seating assignments for exams and go early to make sure you’re in the right place (check the exits to make sure you’re reading it the right way)</p></li>
<li><p>Know where your exam is being held (find it on a map at least a day beforehand). Finals are often in strange places that take a while to find</p></li>
