<h1 class="title">HW3CSE105F24: Homework assignment 3</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105F24</p>
<p class="date">Due: October 22nd at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages,
as well as its boundaries.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 3. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Chapter 1. Chapter 1 exercises 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9,
1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21, 1.22.
Chapter 1 problem 1.51.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw3CSE105F24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Using general constructions</strong> (16 points):
Consider the NFA <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}\)</span> with state diagram</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Give two examples of strings of length greater than <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that are accepted by <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and two examples of strings of length
greater than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that are rejected by
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. For each example string, list at
least one of the computations of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
on this string and label whether this computation witnesses that the
string is accepted by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Use
the “macro-state” construction from Theorem 1.39 and class to create the
DFA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> recognizing the same language
as <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. You only need to include
states that are reachable from the start state. For full credit, submit
(1) a state diagram that is deterministic (there should be arrows
labelled <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> coming out of each state) and where
each state is labelled by a subset of the states in <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>; and (2) for one of your example
strings that is accepted by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, give
the computation of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on this string
as a seqeuence of states visited; and (3) for one of your example
strings that is rejected by <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, give
the computation of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on this string
as a seqeuence of states visited.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give a
mathematical description either using set builder notation or a regular
expression for <span class="math inline">\(L(N)\)</span> and for <span
class="math inline">\(L(M)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple representations</strong> (12 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Consider the language <span class="math inline">\(A_1 = \{ uw
\mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}\)</span>
and the following argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^p 0^p\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and has length greater than or equal
to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> ought to be pump’able. That is, there
should be a way of dividing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into
parts <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in A_1\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are such that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.
Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy|
\leq p\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are made up of all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. If we let <span
class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> because repeating <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and strings in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> are required to have <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be the same length. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we have demonstrated
that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> has no pumping length. By
the Pumping Lemma, this implies that <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is nonregular.</p>

<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span

class="math inline">\(x = \varepsilon\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 1^{p+1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0^{p}\)</span>, we have satisfied that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
positive) and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>. If we
let <span class="math inline">\(i=0\)</span>, we get the string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz = 0^{p}\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> because its middle symbol is a <span

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular and nonregular languages</strong> (12 points): In
Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Prove or disprove each closure claim statement below about the class
of regular languages and the class of nonregular languages. Your
arguments may refer to theorems proved in the textbook and class, and if
they do, should include specific page numbers and references (i.e. write
out the claim that was proved in the book and/or class).</p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have:</p>
<p>For language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we have the
associated sets of strings <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) =
\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ \text{there exist } a,b \in \Sigma_1^* \text{
such that } awb \in L\}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{
for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma_1^* \}\]</span></p>
