<h1 class="title">HW2CSE105W24: Homework assignment 2</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W24</p>
<p class="date">Due: February 1st at 5pm (no penalty late submission
until 8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice designing multiple representations of regular
languages and working with general constructions of automata to
demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages. You will
also distinguish between regular and nonregular languages using both
closure arguments and the pumping lemma.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 2-4. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Chapter 1, Section 2.2. Chapter 1 exercises 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7,
1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21,
1.22, 1.29, 1.30. Chapter 1 problems 1.49, 1.50, 1.51.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw2CSE105W24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Number representations</strong> (12 points): Integers can
be represented using base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions, for a convenient choice of base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>: for <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> an integer greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Design a DFA that recognizes the set of binary (base <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of positive integers that
are powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. A complete
solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief
justification of your construction by explaining the role each state
plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the
strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified
language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) A power of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is an integer <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(2^y\)</span> for some nonnegative integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, (2) the DFA should accept the strings
<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(100000\)</span> and should reject the strings
<span class="math inline">\(010\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1101\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> (can you see why?).</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Consider arbitrary positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Design a DFA that recognizes the set
of binary (base <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of
positive integers that are multiples of <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. A complete solution will include the
formal definition of your DFA (paramterized by <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) and a brief justification of your
construction by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, as
well as a brief justification about how the strings accepted and
rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) Consider having a state for each
possible remainder upon division by <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. (2) To determine transitions, notice
that reading a new character will shift what we already read over by one
slot.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Choose a positive
integer <span class="math inline">\(m_{0}\)</span> between <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span> (inclusive) and draw the state diagram
of a DFA recognizing the language over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2\}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\{
w \in \{0,1,2\}^* \mid w \text{ is a base $3$ expansion of a positive
    integer that is a multiple of $m_0$}\}\]</span> A complete solution
will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief justification of
your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the
machine, as well as a brief justification about how the strings accepted
and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><em>Bonus extension to think about (ungraded):</em></span>
Which other languages related to sets of integers can be proved to be
regular using a similar strategy?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple representations</strong> (10 points): For any
language <span class="math inline">\(L \subseteq \Sigma^*\)</span>,
recall that we define its <em>complement</em> as <span
class="math display">\[\overline{L} := \Sigma^* - L = \{w \in \Sigma^*
\mid w \notin L\}\]</span> That is, the complement of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> contains all and only those strings
which are not in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Our notation
for regular expressions does not include the complement symbol. However,
it turns out that the complement of a language described by a regular
expression is guaranteed to also be describable by a (different) regular
expression. For example, over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>, the complement of the
language described by the regular expression <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma^* 0\)</span> is described by the regular
expression <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \cup
\Sigma^*1\)</span> because any string that does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> must either be the empty string or end
in <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>For each of the regular expressions <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{a,b\}\)</span> below, write the regular
expression for <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>.
Your regular expressions may use the symbols <span
class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the following operations to
combine them: union, concatenation, and Kleene star.</p>
<p>Briefly justify why your solution for each part works by giving plain
English descriptions of the language described by the regular expression
and of its complement and connecting them to the regular expression via
relevant definitions. An English description that is more detailed than
simply negating the description in the original language will likely be
helpful in the justification.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can justify your solution by first designing a DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span>, using the
construction from class and the book to modify this DFA to get a new DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>,
and then applying the constructions from class and the book to convert
this new DFA to a regular expression.</p>
<p>For each part of the question, clearly state which approach you’re
taking and include enough intermediate steps to illustrate your
work.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <span
class="math inline">\(a^*b^*\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <span
class="math inline">\((a \cup b) a b^*\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Applying general constructions</strong> (12 points): In
this question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions
for NFAs and translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.
Consider the following general construction: Let <span
class="math inline">\(N_1 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> be
a NFA and assume that <span class="math inline">\(q_0 \notin Q\)</span>.
Define the new NFA <span class="math inline">\(N_2 = (Q \cup \{q_0\},
\Sigma, \delta_2, q_0, \{q_1\})\)</span> where <span
class="math display">\[\delta_2: (Q \cup \{q_0\}) \times
\Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P} (Q \cup \{q_0\})\]</span> is defined
by <span class="math display">\[\delta_2 (q,a) = \begin{cases}
        \{ q&#39; \in Q \mid q \in \delta_1(q&#39;,a)\} &amp;\text{if $q
\in Q$, $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$} \\
        F_1 &amp;\text{if $q =q_0$, $a = \varepsilon$}\\
        \emptyset &amp;\text{if $q = q_0$, $a \in \Sigma$}
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Illustrate this
construction by defining a specific example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and applying the construction above to
create a new NFA. Your example NFA should</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have exactly three states (all reachable from the start
state),</p></li>
<li><p>Have at least one spontaneous move (arrow labelled <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>),</p></li>
<li><p>Accept at least one string and reject at least one string,
and</p></li>
<li><p>Not have any states labelled <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the construction above to create the new NFA. A complete
submission will include the state diagram of your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the state diagram of the NFA
resulting from this construction.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Use Theorem 1.39
on page 55 of the book (see also page 7 in Week 3 notes) to construct a
DFA equivalent to your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> from part (a). A complete submission
will include the state diagram of your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the state diagram of the DFA
resulting from this construction, with the correct state labels for this
DFA. You may prune the DFA so that only the “macro-states” reachable
from the start state are included.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Explain the
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> in the general construction. Give an
example string that is accepted by your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and is rejected by the NFA that results
from applying the general construction that illustrates this
relationship, or explain why there is no such example string.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Pumping</strong> (8 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Give an example of
a language over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> that has cardinality <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and for which <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is a pumping length and <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is not a pumping length. A complete
solution will give a clear and precise description of the language, a
justification for why <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is a
pumping length, and a justification for why <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is not a pumping length. Is this
language regular?</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Consider the
following attempted “proof" that the set <span class="math display">\[X
= \{ uw \mid \text{$u$ and
$w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}\]</span> is
nonregular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^p 0^p\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and has length greater than or equal to
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
ought to be pump’able. That is, there should be a way of dividing <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into parts <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in X\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are such that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.
Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy|
\leq p\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are made up of all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. If we let <span
class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> because repeating <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and strings in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are required to have <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be the same length. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Since <span

<p>Find the (first and/or most significant) logical error in the “proof"
and describe why it’s wrong. Then, either prove that the set is actually
regular (by finding a regular expression that describes it or a DFA/NFA
that recognizes it, and justifying why) <span><strong>or</strong></span>
fix the proof so that it is logically sound.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) In class and in
the reading so far, we’ve seen the following examples of nonregular
sets:</p>
<div class="multicols">
<p><span>3</span></p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 0 \}\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 2 \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~  0 \leq n \leq m \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~ 0 \leq m \leq n \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^i 1^{2i} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^i 1^{i+1} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^m 0^n ~|~n,m \geq 0\}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* ~|~w = w^R\}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ w w^R ~|~ w \in \{0,1\}^*\}\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Modify one of these sets in some way and use the Pumping Lemma to
prove that the resulting set is still nonregular.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Regular and nonregular languages</strong> (8 points): In
Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Prove or disprove each closure claim statement below about the class
of regular languages and the class of nonregular languages. Your
arguments may refer to theorems proved in the textbook and class, and if
they do, should include specific page numbers and references (i.e. write
out the claim that was proved in the book and/or class).</p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have:</p>
<p>For languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we
have the associated sets of strings <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L_1) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~
\text{there exist } a,b \in \Sigma_1^* \text{ such that } awb \in
L_1\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w \in
\Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and } v
\in L_2 \}\]</span></p>
