<h1 class="title">Project - CSE 105 Spring 2022</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105Sp22</p>
<p class="date">Part 3 due 6/2/22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission
until 8am next day)</p>
</header>
<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p>Why? To go deeper and explore the material from Theory of Computation
and how it relates to other aspects of CS and beyond.</p>
<p>How? During emergency remote instruction last academic year, we
discovered that video assessment and some open-ended personalized
projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for students
than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission also gives
flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p><span><strong>Your videos</strong></span>: We will delete all the
videos we receive from you after assigning final grades for the course,
and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory only accessible to the course staff during the quarter. Please
send an email to the instructor (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here: <a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU">Tutorial
URL</a> The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom
is here: <a
href="{https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxJN6CQcXqIbOekDYMxjh7mTt1TyRVMl}">Video
produced in tutorial</a> .</p>
<p><span><strong>What resources can you use?</strong> </span> This
project must be completed individually, without any help from other
people, including the course staff (other than logistics support if you
get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 105
offering (notes, readings, class videos, supplementary videos, homework
feedback). You may additionally search online to respond to project
parts that explicitly ask you to do so, and you must cite all resources
(online or offline) that you consult as part of this search. Link
directly to the resource and include the name of the author / video
creator and the reason you consulted this reference. The work you submit
for the project needs to be your own.</p>
<p>The written portion of the project is expected to be clearly legible,
and should preferably be typed.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="tasks-for-project-part-3">Tasks for Project
Part 3</h1>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="task-1-explain-a-review-quiz-question-written">Task 1: Explain a
review quiz question (Written)</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Select one question from one of the review quizzes from 5/2/22
(Monday of Week 6) to 5/27/22 (Friday of Week 9) to revisit. Include the
problem description, why you picked this question (e.g. what is
interesting about it, what is hard about it, or why you wanted to take a
second look at it), and your solution. Question selection: you can pick
any one question listed in the Gradescope review quizzes, and you must
address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 105 who
missed that week and is “catching up”.</p></li>
<li><p>Include at least 2 potential mistakes that a student may have
made while attempting to solve the quiz problem that you selected.
Explain why the reasoning behind these mistakes is flawed so that a
student reading this may learn from these mistakes. It’s a good idea to
include mistakes that you made when you first tried to solve this
problem!</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Style guidelines</strong></span>: your written
submission for Task 1 should clearly label the three parts:
<span><em>Question Selection</em></span>,
<span><em>Solution</em></span>, and <span><em>Potential
Mistakes</em></span>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered"
id="task-2-proving-undecidability-with-mapping-reductions-written">Task
2: Proving undecidability with mapping reductions (Written)</h2>
<p>Define: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        L_n &amp;= \{ \langle M \rangle \mid \textrm{$M$ is a Turing
machine and } |L(M)| = n\} \\
        X_{y} &amp; = \{ \langle M \rangle \mid \textrm{$M$ is a Turing
machine and } y \in L(M)\} \\
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Option 1: Pick a specific positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and you will show that <span
class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> is undecidable.</p>
<p>Option 2: Pick a specific string <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and you will show that <span
class="math inline">\(X_y\)</span> is undecidable.</p>
<p>For either option:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Clearly specify whether you chose Option 1 or Option 2, and
specify the value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> you picked.</p></li>
<li><p>Give two specific examples of strings in the set <span
class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(X_y\)</span>, and two specific examples of strings
not in the set. Justify your examples with specific connections between
the strings and the definition of the set.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick whether you will mapping reduce <span
class="math inline">\(A_{TM}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(HALT_{TM}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{A_{TM}}\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{HALT_{TM}}\)</span> to your set. Define
<span><strong>two different</strong></span> computable functions that
can witness the mapping reduction. Prove that each of these functions
witnesses the mapping reduction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you get stuck:</p>
<p>We want you to demonstrate your knowledge about mapping reductions in
this part of the project. As professionals, it’s important to realize
when we don’t know or unsure about something. In grading your work on
this part of the project, some partial credit will be available for
partial correct progress on the task and then explanations of where you
got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="task-3-video-about-computable-functions">Task
3: Video about computable functions</h2>
<p>To relate the difficulty level of one language to another we use
mapping reduction, which relies on the notion of computable function. In
this part of the project, you will define and explain a specific
computable function from <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. Create a
3-5 minute screencast video with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you
are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the
video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the function you will be working with. You can pick any
function you like so long as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Its domain is <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> and
its codomain is <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>It is not the identity map (that sends every string to itself),
and it is not the function we worked through in class <span
class="math inline">\(f_1: \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^*\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(f_1(x) = x0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your video should include a clear and precise definition of the
function.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a high-level description of a Turing machine witnessing that
your function is computable.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the state diagram and formal definition of a Turing
machine witnessing that your function is computable.</p></li>
<li><p>Trace the computation of the Turing machine whose state diagram
you gave on an input of length <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this video along with a written version of Tasks 1
and 2 to Gradescope.</p>
<p><span><strong>Extra exploration (not for credit)</strong></span>:
What would it take to implement your computable function in code in a
programming language of your choosing? Could you use this computable
function to witness any mapping reductions?</p>
<h1 id="grading-criteria-and-checklists">Grading Criteria and
checklists</h1>
<p><span><strong>Task 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Submission covers a complete review quiz question from the relevant
weeks (all parts of the question must be addressed for multi-part
questions).</p>
<p>Submission clearly labels review questions, including which day it’s
from and the problem description.</p>
<p>Submission includes why the student picked the problem/ what they
found interesting.</p>
<p>Solution is written (or typed) out in detail step-by-step, with clear
and correct logic and justification.</p>
<p>Submission includes 2 potential mistakes that a student might make
while solving this question and explains why they are wrong.</p>
<p><span><strong>Task 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Submission clearly specify whether Option 1 or Option 2 is chosen,
and clearly specifies the value of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as appropriate.</p>
<p>Two specific examples of strings in the set and two specific examples
of strings not in the set are included. Justifications of membership /
non-membership are complete, clear, correct, and precise. Explanations
include specific refereence to the example and to relevant
definitions.</p>
<p>Each of the two mapping reductions clearly identify the sets involved
and include a high-level definition for a Turing machine witnessing the
mapping reduction, an analysis of the output of the function for
possible inputs, and a connection with the definition of mapping
reduction. Definitions and explanations are complete, clear, correct,
and precise.</p>
<p><span><strong>Task 3</strong></span></p>
<p>Logistics Items</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Video loads correctly</p></li>
<li><p>Video is between 3 and 5 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Video shows the student’s face and ID, and they introduce
themselves audibly while on screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The video clearly presents a function which is well-defined and
computable.</p>
<p>The video presents a correct high-level description of a Turing
machine that computes this function.</p>
<p>The video presents a complete and correct formal definition of a
Turing machine that computes this function, including a state
diagram.</p>
<p>The video includes a trace of the computation of this Turing machine
on an input of length <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, where each
step of the trace is included and shows the contents of the tape, the
location of the read-write head, and the control state of the machine.
The trace compares the Turing machine behavior with the expected output
of the function on this input string.</p>
