<h1 class="title">HW3CSE105W24: Homework assignment 3</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W24</p>
<p class="date">Due: February 15th at 5pm (no penalty late submission
until 8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice with the definition of pushdown automata and
context-free grammars and reason about regular and context-free
languages. You will also practice analyzing and designing Turing
machines.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 4-6. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Chapter 2, Section 3.1 Chapter 2 exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4,
2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16, 2.17. Chapter 3
exercises 3.1, 3.2.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw3CSE105W24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Constructions</strong> (18 points):</p>
<p>Consider the push-down automata <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> with stack alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{a, b\}\)</span> whose state diagrams are</p>

<p>State diagram for <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
What is the language <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> recognized
by <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and what is the language
<span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> recognized by <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>? Include a sample string that is
accepted and one that is rejected for each of these PDA. Justify these
examples with sample accepting computations or with an explanation why
there is no accepting computation.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Design CFGs <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(G_1) = A_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L(G_2) = A_2\)</span>. A complete solution will
include precise definitions for each of the parameters required to
specify a CFG, as well as a brief explanation about why each string in
<span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> can be derived in <span
class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span> and each string not in <span
class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> cannot be derived in <span
class="math inline">\(G_i\)</span> (for <span
class="math inline">\(i=1,2\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Remember that the
definition of set-wise concatenation is: for languages <span
class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the associated set of
strings <span class="math display">\[L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w \in \Sigma^*
~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and } v \in L_2
\}\]</span> In class (and in the review quiz) we learned that the class
of context-free languages is closed under set-wise concatenation. The
proof of this closure claim using CFGs uses the construction: given
<span class="math inline">\(G_1 = ( V_1, \Sigma, R_1, S_1)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(G_2 = (V_2, \Sigma, R_2, S_2)\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(V_1 \cap V_2 = \emptyset\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(S_{new} \notin V_1 \cup V_2\)</span>, define a new
CFG <span class="math display">\[G = (V_1 \cup V_2 \cup \{S_{new}\},
\Sigma, R_1 \cup R_2 \cup \{S_{new} \to S_1 S_2\}, S_{new})\]</span>
Apply this construction to your grammars from part (b) and give a sample
derivation of a string in <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \circ
A_2\)</span> in this resulting grammar.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) If we try to
extrapolate the construction that we used to prove that the class of
regular languages is closed under set-wise concategation, we would get
the following construction for PDAs: Given <span
class="math inline">\(M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1, \delta_1, q_1,
F_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma,
\Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset\)</span>, define <span
class="math inline">\(Q = Q_1 \cup Q_2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_2\)</span>, and
<span class="math display">\[M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_1,
F_2)\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\delta: Q \times
\Sigma_\varepsilon \times \Gamma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q \times
\Gamma_\varepsilon)\)</span> given by <span
class="math display">\[\delta( q,a,b) = \begin{cases}
        \delta_1 (q,a,b) &amp;\text{if $q \in Q_1 \setminus F_1$, $a \in
\Sigma_\varepsilon$, $b \in {\Gamma_1}_\varepsilon$} \\
        \delta_2 (q,a,b) &amp;\text{if $q \in Q_2$, $a \in
\Sigma_\varepsilon$, $b \in {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon$} \\
        \delta_1 (q,a,b) &amp;\text{if $q \in F_1$, $a \in \Sigma$ or
$b\in \Gamma_1$}\\
        \delta_1 (q,a,b) \cup \{ (q_2, \varepsilon)\} &amp;\text{if $q
\in F_1$, $a =\varepsilon$, $b=\varepsilon$}\\
        \emptyset &amp;\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]</span> Apply this construction to the machines <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> from part (a), and then use the
resulting PDA to prove that <span><em>this</em></span> construction
cannot be used to prove that the class of context-free languages is
closed under set-wise concatenation. A complete solution will include
(1) the state diagram of the machine <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that results from applying this
construction to <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, (2) an example of a string that is
accepted by this PDA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> but that is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> in the language <span
class="math inline">\(A_1 \circ A_2\)</span> with a description of the
computation that witnesses that this string is accepted by <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and an explanation of why this string
is not in <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \circ A_2\)</span> by
referring back to the definitions of <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>, and set-wise concatenation.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular languages are context-free</strong> (10
points):</p>
<p>Informally, we think of regular languages as potentially simpler than
context-free languages. In this question, you’ll make this precise by
showing that every regular language is context-free, in two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) When we first
introduced PDAs we saw that any NFA can be transformed to a PDA by not
using the stack of the PDA at all. Make this precise by completing the
following construction: Given a NFA <span class="math inline">\(N = (Q,
\Sigma, \delta_N, q_0, F)\)</span> we define a PDA <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(L(M) =
L(N)\)</span> by choosing … A complete solution will have precise,
correct definitions for each of the defining parameters of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: the set of states, the input alphabet,
the stack alphabet, the transition function, the start state, and the
set of accept states. Be careful to use notation that matches the types
of the objects involved.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In the book on
page 107, the top paragraph describes a procedure for converting DFA to
CFGs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can convert any DFA into an equivalent CFG as follows. Make a
variable <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> for each state <span
class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> of the DFA. Add the rule <span
class="math inline">\(R_i \to aR_j\)</span> to the CFG if <span
class="math inline">\(\delta(q_i,a) =q_j\)</span> is a transition in the
DFA. Add the rule <span class="math inline">\(R_i\to
\varepsilon\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is an
accept state of the DFA. Make <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>
the start variable ofthe grammar, where <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> is the start state of the machine.
Verify on your own that the resulting CFG generates the same language
that the DFA recognizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use this construction to get a context-free grammar generating the
language <span class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid w \text{
does not have $11$ as a substring}\}\]</span> by (1) designing a DFA
that recognizes this language and then (2) applying the construction
from the book to convert the DFA to an equivalent CFG. A complete
submission will include the state diagram of the DFA, a brief
justification of why it recognizes the language, and then the complete
and precise definition of the CFG that results from applying the
construction from the book to this DFA. <span><em>Ungraded bonus: take a
sample string in the language and see how the computation of the DFA on
this string translates to a derivation in your
grammar.</em></span></p></li>
</ol></li>
