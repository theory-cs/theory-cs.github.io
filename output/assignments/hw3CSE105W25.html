<h1 class="title">HW3CSE105W25: Homework assignment 3</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W25</p>
<p class="date">Due: February 6th at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages,
as well as its boundaries, and explore push-down automata and their
design.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 3 and Week 4. We will
post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Chapter 1 and Section 2.2. Chapter 1 exercises 1.28, 1.29, 1.30.
Chapter 1 problem 1.53, 1.54, 1.55. Chapter 2 exercises 2.7, 2.10.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>On the “graded for correctness" questions, you may only
collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group. You may ask questions
about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or
tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw3CSE105W25”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Static analysis</strong> (10 points): In software
engineering, static analysis is an approach to debugging and testing
where the properties of a piece of code are inferred without actually
running it. In the context of finite automata, we can think of static
analysis as the process of inferring properties of the language
recognized by a finite automaton from properties of the graph underlying
its state diagram. The Pumping Lemma is one example of static analysis.
In this question, you’ll explore other examples of how properties of the
graph underlying the state diagram of a machine can give us information
about the language recognized by the machine.</p>

reachable from the start state of <span

<li><p><strong>Multiple representations</strong> (12 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Consider the language <span class="math inline">\(A_1 = \{ uw
\mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}\)</span>
and the following argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^p 0^p\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and has length greater than or equal
to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> ought to be pump’able. That is, there
should be a way of dividing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into
parts <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in A_1\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are such that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.
Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy|
\leq p\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are made up of all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. If we let <span
class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> because repeating <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and strings in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> are required to have <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be the same length. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we have demonstrated
that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> has no pumping length. By
the Pumping Lemma, this implies that <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is nonregular.</p>

class="math inline">\(x = \varepsilon\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 1^{p+1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0^{p}\)</span>, we have satisfied that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
positive) and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>. If we
let <span class="math inline">\(i=0\)</span>, we get the string <span

</div>
</div>
<p>Modify one of these sets in some way and use the Pumping Lemma to
prove that the resulting set is still nonregular.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular and nonregular languages</strong> (12 points): In
Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Recall the definitions of operations we’ve talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over an alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the associated sets of
strings (also over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span
class="math display">\[L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{
and each } w_i \in L\}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there
exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}\]</span> and
<span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv
\text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^*
\}\]</span> Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for
any sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <span class="math display">\[X \cup Y =
\{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y
\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Use the general
constructions that we developed to prove the closure of the class of
regular languages under various operations to produce the state diagram
of a NFA that recognizes the language <span
class="math display">\[(~SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})~)^*\]</span>
<span><em>Hint: Question 4 from Homework 2 might be
helpful.</em></span></p>
<p>For full credit, submit (1) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,01,111\}\)</span>, (2) a state diagram
of an NFA that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(\{0, 01,
111\})\)</span>, and (3) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes <span
class="math inline">\((~SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})~)^*\)</span>, and a
brief justification of each state diagram that references the language
being recognized or the general constructions being used.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Prove that the
class of nonregular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is not closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span> operation by giving an example

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Pick one of the
regular languages and design a regular expression that describes it and
a DFA that recognizes it. Briefly justify your regular expression by
connecting the subexpressions of it to the intended language and
referencing relevant definitions. Briefly justify your DFA design by
explaining the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief
justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine
connect to the specified language.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Pick one of the
nonregular languages and design a PDA that recognizes it. Draw the state
diagram of your PDA. Briefly justify your design by explaining the role
each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about
how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
specified language.</p></li>

the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your
ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Whether you use
formal proof techniques or write a more informal argument for why
something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your
goal should be to convince the reader that your results and methods are
