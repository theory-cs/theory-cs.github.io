<h1 class="title">HW2CSE105F24: Homework assignment 2</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105F24</p>
<p class="date">Due: October 15th at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice designing multiple representations of regular
languages and working with general constructions of automata to
demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 2. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. Chapter 1 exercises 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7,
1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.19, 1.20, 1.21,
1.22. Chapter 1 problem 1.51.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw2CSE105F24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Automata design</strong> (12 points): As background to
this question, recall that integers can be represented using base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansions, for any convenient choice
of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The precise definition
is: for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> an integer greater than
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Design a DFA that recognizes the set of binary (base <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of positive integers that
are powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. A complete
solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief
justification of your construction by explaining the role each state
plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the
strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified
language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) A power of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is an integer <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(2^y\)</span> for some nonnegative integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, (2) the DFA should accept the strings
<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(100000\)</span> and should reject the strings
<span class="math inline">\(010\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1101\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> (can you see why?).</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Consider
arbitrary positive integer <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.
Design a DFA that recognizes the set of binary (base <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of positive integers that
are multiples of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. A complete
solution will include the formal definition of your DFA (paramterized by
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) and a brief justification of
your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the
machine, as well as a brief justification about how the strings accepted
and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) Consider having a state for each
possible remainder upon division by <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. (2) To determine transitions, notice
that reading a new character will shift what we already read over by one
slot.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Choose a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(m_{0}\)</span>
between <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span> (inclusive) and draw the state diagram
of a DFA recognizing the following language over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1,2,3\}\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{0,1,2,3\}^* \mid w \text{ is a base
$4$ expansion of a positive
    integer that is a multiple of $m_0$}\}\]</span> A complete solution
will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief justification of
your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the
machine, as well as a brief justification about how the strings accepted
and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><em>Bonus extension to think about (ungraded):</em></span>
Which other languages related to sets of integers can be proved to be
regular using a similar strategy?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nondeterminism</strong> (15 points): For this question,
the alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Design a DFA that
recognizes the language <span class="math display">\[\{w \in \{a,b\}^*
\mid w \text{ contains at most one $a$ {\bf and} at least two
$b$s}\}\]</span> You can design this DFA directly or use the
constructions from class (and the footnote to Theorem 1.25 in the book)
to build this DFA from DFA for the simpler languages that are
intersected to give this language.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a
brief justification of your construction either by explaining the role
each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about
how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
specified language, or by justifying the design of the DFA for the
simpler languages and then describing how the Theorem was used.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Design a NFA with
at most <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> states that recognizes
the language <span class="math display">\[\{w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w
\text{ contains at most one $a$ {\bf and} at least two $b$s}\}\]</span>
A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and a
brief justification of your construction by explaining the role each
state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how
the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
specified language. Give one example string in the language and explain
the computation of the NFA that witnesses that the machine accepts this
string. Also, give one example string not in the language and explain
why the NFA rejects this string.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Design a NFA with
at most <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> states that recognizes
the language <span class="math display">\[\{w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w
\text{ contains at most one $a$ {\bf or} at least two $b$s}\}\]</span> A
complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and a brief
justification of your construction by explaining the role each state
plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the
strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified
language. Give one example string in the language and explain the
computation of the NFA that witnesses that the machine accepts this
string. Also, give one example string not in the language and explain
why the NFA rejects this string.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><em>Bonus extension to think about (ungraded):</em></span> Did
you need all <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> states? Could you
design DFA with <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> states that
recognize each of these langauges?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General constructions</strong> (15 points): In this
question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for
NFAs and translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Consider the
following general construction: Let <span class="math inline">\(N_1 =
(Q, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> be a NFA and assume that <span
class="math inline">\(q_0 \notin Q\)</span>. Define the new NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N_2 = (Q \cup \{q_0\}, \Sigma, \delta_2, q_0,
\{q_1\})\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[\delta_2: (Q \cup
\{q_0\}) \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P} (Q \cup
\{q_0\})\]</span> is defined by <span class="math display">\[\delta_2
(q,a) = \begin{cases}
        \{ q&#39; \in Q \mid q \in \delta_1(q&#39;,a)\} &amp;\text{if $q
\in Q$, $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$} \\
        F_1 &amp;\text{if $q =q_0$, $a = \varepsilon$}\\
        \emptyset &amp;\text{if $q = q_0$, $a \in \Sigma$}
    \end{cases}\]</span> Illustrate this construction by defining a
specific example NFA <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and
applying the construction above to create the new NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span>. Your example NFA should</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have exactly four states (all reachable from the start
state),</p></li>
<li><p>Accept at least one string and reject at least one string,
and</p></li>
<li><p>Not have any states labelled <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the construction above to create the new NFA. A complete
submission will include the state diagram of your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and the state diagram of the NFA
<span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> resulting from this
construction and a precise and clear description of <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_2)\)</span>, justified by explaining the role
each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about
how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
language.</p></li>
<li><p>In Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have: For each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we have the
associated set of strings <span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w
\in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and }
v \in \Sigma_1^* \}\]</span> We will prove that the collection of
languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> that are
each recognizable by some NFA is closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span> operation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) As a helpful tool
in our construction<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, prove that every NFA can be
converted to an equivalent one that has a single accept state. Note:
this is exercise 1.11 in the textbook.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that the
collection of languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> that are each recognizable by
some NFA is closed under the <span class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span>
operation. You can assume that you are given a NFA with a single accept
state <span class="math inline">\(N = (Q, \{0,1\}, \delta, q_0,
\{q_{acc}\})\)</span> and you need to define a new NFA, <span
class="math inline">\(N_{new} = (Q_{new}, \{0,1\}, \delta_{new},
q_{new}, F_{new})\)</span>, so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_{new}) = EXTEND(L(N))\)</span>.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include precise definitions for <span
class="math inline">\(Q_{new}, \delta_{new}, q_{new},\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span>, as well as a a brief
justification of your construction by explaining why these definitions
work, referring specifically to the definition of <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span> and to acceptance of NFA.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple representations</strong> (8 points): For any
language <span class="math inline">\(L \subseteq \Sigma^*\)</span>,
recall that we define its <em>complement</em> as <span
class="math display">\[\overline{L} := \Sigma^* - L = \{w \in \Sigma^*
\mid w \notin L\}\]</span> That is, the complement of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> contains all and only those strings
which are not in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Our notation
for regular expressions does not include the complement symbol. However,
it turns out that the complement of a language described by a regular
expression is guaranteed to also be describable by a (different) regular
expression.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma =
\{a,b\}\)</span>, the complement of the language described by the
regular expression <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^* b\)</span> is
described by the regular expression <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \cup \Sigma^*a\)</span> because any
string that does not end in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must
either be the empty string or end in <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>For each of the regular expressions <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{a,b\}\)</span> below, write the regular
expression for <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>.
Your regular expressions may use the symbols <span
class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the following operations to
combine them: union, concatenation, and Kleene star.</p>
<p>Briefly justify why your solution for each part works by giving plain
English descriptions of the language described by the regular expression
and of its complement and connecting them to the regular expression via
relevant definitions. An English description that is more detailed than
simply negating the description in the original language will likely be
helpful in the justification.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can justify your solution by first designing a DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span>, using the
construction from class and the book to modify this DFA to get a new DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>,
and then applying the constructions from class and the book to convert
this new DFA to a regular expression.</p>
<p>For each part of the question, clearly state which approach you’re
taking and include enough intermediate steps to illustrate your
work.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This means you will get full credit so long as your
submission demonstrates honest effort to answer the question. You will
not be penalized for incorrect answers. To demonstrate your honest
effort in answering the question, we expect you to include your attempt
to answer *each* part of the question. If you get stuck with your
attempt, you can still demonstrate your effort by explaining where you
got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.<a href="#fnref1"

<li id="fn2"><p>This means your solution will be evaluated not only on
the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your
ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Whether you use
formal proof techniques or write a more informal argument for why
something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your
goal should be to convince the reader that your results and methods are
sound.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>A result that is proved in order to work towards a
larger theorem is called a Lemma.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"

in class that the complement of each language recognizable by a DFA is
recognizable by a(nother) DFA.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
