<h1 class="title">HW2CSE105W25: Homework assignment 2</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W25</p>
<p class="date">Due: January 30th at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice designing multiple representations of regular
languages and working with general constructions of automata to
demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 2 and Week 3. We will
post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. Chapter 1 exercises 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7,
1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19,
1.20, 1.21, 1.22, 1.23. Chapter 1 problem 1.31, 1.36, 1.37.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>On the “graded for correctness" questions, you may only
collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group. You may ask questions
about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or
tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw2CSE105W25”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Finite automata</strong> (10 points): Consider the finite
automaton <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0,
F)\)</span> whose state diagram is depicted below</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Write the formal definition of this automaton. In other words, give the
five defining parameters <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span> so that they are consistent with the
state diagram of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Give a regular expression <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> so that
<span class="math inline">\(L(R) = L(M)\)</span>. In other words, we
want a regular expression that describes the language recognized by this
finite automaton. Justify your answer by referring to the definition of
the semantics of regular expressions and computations of finite
automata. Include an explanation for why each string in <span
class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span> is accepted by the finite automaton
<span><em>and</em></span> for why each string not in <span
class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span> is rejected by the finite
automaton.</p>
<p><span><em>Ungraded bonus: can you find more than one such regular
expression?</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Keeping the same
set of states <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, input alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, same start state <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, and same transition function <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, choose a new set of accepting
states <span class="math inline">\(F_{new1}\)</span> so that the new
finite automaton <span class="math inline">\(M_1 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta,
q_0, F_{new1})\)</span> that results recognizes a <span><strong>proper
superset</strong></span> of <span class="math inline">\(L(M)\)</span>,
or explain why there is no such example. A complete solution will
include either (1) a precise and clear description of your choice of
<span class="math inline">\(F_{new1}\)</span> <span><em>and</em></span>
a precise and clear explanation of why every string that is accepted by
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is also accepted by <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> <span><em>and</em></span> an example
of a string that is accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>
and is rejected by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>; or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Keeping the same
set of states <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, input alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, same start state <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, and same transition function <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, choose a new set of accepting
states <span class="math inline">\(F_{new2}\)</span> so that the new
finite automaton <span class="math inline">\(M_2 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta,
q_0, F_{new2})\)</span> that results recognizes a <span><strong>nonempty
proper subset</strong></span> of <span
class="math inline">\(L(M)\)</span>, or explain why there is no such
example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear
description of your choice of <span
class="math inline">\(F_{new2}\)</span> <span><em>and</em></span> an
example string accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>
<span><em>and</em></span> a precise and clear explanation of why every
string that is accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> is
also accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
<span><em>and</em></span> an example of a string that is accepted by
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and is rejected by <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>; or (2) a sufficiently general and
correct argument why there is no such example, referring back to the
relevant definitions.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Automata design</strong> (12 points): As background to
this question, recall that integers can be represented using base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansions, for any convenient choice
of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The precise definition
is: for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> an integer greater than
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Design a DFA that
recognizes the set of binary (base <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of positive integers that
are powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. A complete
solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief
justification of your construction by explaining the role each state
plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the
strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified
language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) A power of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is an integer <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(2^y\)</span> for some nonnegative integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, (2) the DFA should accept the strings
<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(100000\)</span> and should reject the strings
<span class="math inline">\(010\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1101\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> (can you see why?).</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Design a DFA that
recognizes the set of binary (base <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of positive integers that
are less than <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. Your DFA must use
<span><strong>fewer than ten states</strong></span>. A complete solution
will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief justification of
your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the
machine, as well as a brief justification about how the strings accepted
and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Find a positive
integer <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> so that there is a DFA that recognizes
the set of base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> expansions of
positive integers that are less than <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and it uses as few states as possible.
A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a
brief justification of your choice of base.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint: sometimes rewriting the defining membership condition
for a set in different ways helps us find alternate representations of
that set.</em></span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Nondeterminism</strong> (15 points): For this question,
the alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Design a NFA that
recognizes the language <span class="math display">\[L_1 = \{w \in
\{a,b,c\}^* \mid w \text{ starts with $a$ {\bf and} ends with
$a$}\}\]</span></p>
<p>A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and a
brief justification of your construction that explains the role each
state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how
the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
specified language.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Design a NFA that
recognizes the language <span class="math display">\[L_2 = \{w \in
\{a,b,c\}^* \mid w \text{ has no consecutive repeated
characters}\}\]</span> For example, the empty string, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(bac\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(abca\)</span> are each elements of this language
but <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(abb\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(abbc\)</span> are not elements of this
language.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and a
brief justification of your construction that explains the role each
state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how
the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
specified language.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Consider the
language <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
L_1 \cup L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w &amp;\text{ starts with $a$
and ends with $a$} \\
&amp;\text{{\bf or} has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
\end{align*}\]</span> Give at least two representations of this language
among the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A regular expression that describes <span
class="math inline">\(L_1 \cup L_2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>A DFA that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \cup
L_2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>A NFA that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \cup
L_2\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can design your automata directly or use the constructions from
class and chapter 1 in the book to build these automata from automata
for the simpler languages.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include at least two of the representations
as well as a brief justification of each construction.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Consider the
language <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    L_1 \cap L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w &amp;\text{ starts with
$a$ and ends with $a$} \\
    &amp;\text{{\bf and} has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
\end{align*}\]</span> Give at least two representations of this language
among the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A regular expression that describes <span
class="math inline">\(L_1 \cap L_2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>A DFA that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \cap
L_2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>A NFA that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \cap
L_2\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can design your automata directly or use the constructions from
class and chapter 1 in the book to build these automata from automata
for the simpler languages.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include at least two of the representations
as well as a brief justification of each construction.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>General constructions</strong> (13 points): In this
question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for
automata and translating between state diagrams and formal
definitions.</p>
<p>Recall the definitions of operations we’ve talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over an alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the associated sets of
strings (also over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span
class="math display">\[L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{
and each } w_i \in L\}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there
exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}\]</span> and
<span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv
\text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^*
\}\]</span> Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for
any sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <span class="math display">\[X \cup Y =
\{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y
\}\]</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1,
F_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma,
\delta_2, q_2, F_2)\)</span> be DFA.</p>
<p>For simplicity, assume that <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 \cap Q_2
= \emptyset\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(q_0 \notin Q_1
\cup Q_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the following definitions of new automata parameterized by
these DFA:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The NFA <span class="math inline">\(N_\alpha = ( Q_1 \cup Q_2
\cup \{q_0\}, \Sigma, \delta_\alpha, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)\)</span> with
the transition function given by <span
class="math display">\[\delta_\alpha ( ~(q,x)~) = \begin{cases}

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) If possible,
associate each construction above with one of the operations whose
definitions we recalled at the start of the question. For example, is it
the case that (for all choices of DFA <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>) <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_\alpha) = L(M_1) \cup L(M_2)\)</span>? or
<span class="math inline">\(L(N_\alpha) = L(M_1) \cap L(M_2)\)</span>?
etc.</p>
<p>A complete solution will consider each of the constructions <span
class="math inline">\(N_\alpha, N_\beta, N_\gamma\)</span> in turn, and
for each, either name the operation that’s associated with the
construction (and explain why) or explain why none of the operations
mentioned is associated with the construction.</p></li>
