<h1 class="title">ProjectCSE105W24: Project</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W24</p>
<p class="date">Due February 22 at 5pm (no penalty late submission until
8am next day)</p>
</header>
<p>The CSE 105 project is designed for you to go deeper and extend your
work on assignments and to explore an application of your choosing. The
project is an individual assignment and has two tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Implementing the construction that converts NFA to DFA,
and</p>
<p>Task 2: Illustrating the theorem that every regular language is
decidable</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE
105 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback). Tools
for drawing state diagrams (like Flap.js and JFLAP) can be used to help
draw the diagrams in the project too. These resources should be more
than enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look
elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any
resources you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them),
including any large-language model style resources. Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator, any search
strings or prompts you used, and the reason you consulted this
reference.</p>
<p>The work you submit for the project needs to be your own. Again, you
shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than this quarter’s material and
doing so may result in definitions or notations that conflict with our
norms in this class so think carefully before you go down this path.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any part of the project, we encourage you to
focus on communicating what you think the question might mean, including
bringing an example from class or homework you think might be relevant,
and include any submission any aspect where you’re unsure. Clear
communication about these theoretical ideas and their applications ia
one of the main goals of the project.</p>
<p><span><strong>Submitting the project</strong></span> You will submit
a PDF plus a video file for the first task and a PDF for the second
task. All file submissions will be in Gradescope.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-1-implementing-a-construction">Task 1:
Implementing a construction</h3>
<p>Nondeterminism is a useful theoretical concept because it can make
designs simpler and more modular. However, our actual devices are
deterministic. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a language
that can be represented using nondeterminism in some interesting way,
then illustrate the construction that converts NFA to DFA for this
example.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose an alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>
for this entire first task of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that takes as input a
representation of an NFA over this alphabet and outputs a representation
of a DFA over this alphabet that recognizes the same language. You get
to choose the way NFA and DFA are represented, so long as it is general
enough to represent any NFA and any DFA over this alphabet. For
simplicity: you can restrict your attention to NFA **without spontaneous
moves** (in other words, where the transition function has domain <span
class="math inline">\(Q \times \Sigma\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the set of states of the NFA).
Informally, this means that the nondeterminism is coming from there
being zero, one, or more arrows coming out of each state for each
character in the alphabet and there are no arrows with <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> labels.</p>
<p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT to
help you write this program. However, you should test the code that is
produced and be able to explain what it is doing. As a header in your
code file, include a comment block describing any resources that were
used to help generate your code.</p>
<p>Whenever your program is run, it should display a representation of
the input NFA and of the output DFA of the run.</p></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, design a NFA over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with three states and with no
spontaneous moves where the language of the NFA is neither <span
class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span> and draw its state diagram. Your
NFA should use nondeterminism in some way. In other words, the state
diagram you draw can’t already be the state diagram of a DFA. Run your
program with the NFA you just designed to output a representation of an
equivalent DFA and demonstrate its design and the test case on
video.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span></p>
<p>For this task, you will submit a PDF plus a video file.</p>
<p>The PDF should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear specification of alphabet and state diagram of chosen
three-state NFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation for program converting NFA to DFA: include a
description of how NFA and DFA are represented in the program and give
instructions for running it.</p></li>
<li><p>Printout of code for program converting NFA to DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Screen shots of demonstration of running your program on your
chosen NFA, including the representation of the output DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Solution is typed or clearly hand drawn with precise language and
notation for all terms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. To
demonstrate your work, you will create a 3-5 minute screencast video
with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you
are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the
video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the NFA you will be working with. Your video should
include a clear and precise explanation of why the language of this NFA
is not empty and also not the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the code for your program,
including the software design choices you made (e.g. which data
structures are you using, etc.) and any resources you used. The video
should clearly describe which programming language was chosen for the
implementation and gives the reasons why.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the representation of the NFA that
you will input to the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate running your code on your example input. The video
should include screencasts of running the code live. Explain why the
output of your program is what you would expect, by connecting the
output of the program to a DFA and discussing which strings are accepted
/ rejected by this DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Logistics: video needs to load correctly, be between 3 and 5
minutes, show your face and ID, and you introduce yourself audibly while
on screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Clarity and brevity are both
important aspects of your video. In previous years, we’ve seen students
speed up their videos to get below the 5 minute upper bound. This is ok
so long as it doesn’t compromise clarity.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-2-illustrating-a-theorem">Task 2:
Illustrating a theorem</h3>
<p>In this part of the project, you’ll choose a pattern in an
application you care about, define it precisely, build a DFA that
recognizes it, and then build the related Turing machine that proves
that the language encoding this pattern is decidable.</p>
<p>First, pick <span><strong>one</strong></span> application for your
example. Here are some ideas to get you started - but you can choose to
go in a different direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data validation for input in text files (e.g. emails with
specific domains, dates in specific formats, PIDs in a class list,
etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finding ASCII codes for punctuation in a binary file.</p></li>
<li><p>The CDC recommended procedure for hand washing (Refer to the
guidelines from the CDC here <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html</a>
in your explanation. You might find the first example in chapter 1 about
automatic door controllers helpful when starting your design.)</p></li>
<li><p>See more ideas here: <a
href="https://theory-cs.github.io/files/practical-applications-of-theory-of-computation.pdf">https://theory-cs.github.io/files/practical-applications-of-theory-of-computation.pdf</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In a paragraph or so, give the context for your chosen
application and why you chose it.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the alphabet for your example and write a precise
(mathematical and/or English) description of a set of strings over this
alphabet that is relevant to this application, and include a sentence or
so justifying why this set is important and relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Give one example of a string over this alphabet in this set and a
string over this (same) alphabet not in this set, and explain why you
chose these example strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Design a DFA that recognizes this language. Clearly draw and
label the state diagram of this DFA and briefly justify why your design
works by describing the role of each state of the DFA and relating it to
a plain English description of the language you picked.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the construction in the proof that all regular languages are
decidable (informally described in Theorem 4.1 in the book) to build a
Turing machine that simulates your DFA. Hint: your Turing machine will
have exactly two more states than your DFA. Draw the state diagram of
your Turing machine.</p></li>
<li><p>For one of the strings from step 4., draw a representation of the
computation of your Turing machine on this string. Remember that to
describe the computation of a Turing machine, we need to include the
contents of the tape, the state of the machine, and the location of the
read/write head at each step in the computation. In class we’ve drawn
pictures to represent the configuration of the machine at each step in a
computation. You may do so or you may choose to describe these
configurations in words.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solution typed or clearly hand-written/drawn with precise
language and notation for all terms and complete, correct, and clear
justification.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the six steps is complete and included in the PDF, with
precise language and notation for all terms and complete, correct, and
clear justification.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-video">Your video:</h3>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
