<h1 class="title">ProjectCSE105W25: Project</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W25</p>
<p class="date">Due March 19, 2025 at 8am</p>
</header>
<p>The CSE 105 project is designed for you to go deeper and extend your
work on assignments and to see how some of the abstract notions we
discuss can be implemented in concrete ways. The project is an
individual assignment and has two tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Checking the consistency of two regular properties, and</p>
<p>Task 2: Illustrating a mapping reduction</p>
<p>In each task, you’ll be implementing some of the theoretical concepts
we’ve talked about in a programming language of your choosing, and then
presenting your reasoning and demonstrating your code. Getting practice
with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in
general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You should be the architect of your
approach to the project. You can refer to any of this quarter’s CSE 105
offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback). Tools for
drawing state diagrams (like Flap.js and JFLAP and the PrairieLearn
automata library) can be used to help draw the diagrams in the project
too. However, do not copy / screenshot material that was not produced by
you directly to your project writeup. Instead, you can refer to it in
your own words and include a citation to the resource you
referenced.</p>
<p>These resources should be more than enough. If you are struggling to
get started and want to look elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this
by listing and citing any resources you consult (even if you do not
explicitly quote them), including any large-language model style
resources (ChatGPT, Bard, Co-Pilot, etc.). Link directly to them and
include the name of the author / video creator, any and all search
strings or prompts you used, and the reason you consulted this
reference. Also, a word of caution, make sure you validate and check any
code produced by these aids. Last quarter there were a lot of examples
of project submissions that fed the prompt of the project directly to a
LLM code generator and got wrong implementations back.</p>
<p><span><strong>Submitting the project</strong></span> You will submit
a PDF plus a video file (.mp4) for each. All file submissions will be in
Gradescope. Upload the four files themselves. It is your responsibility
to ensure that the files are playable within Gradescope. No Google Drive
links, YouTube links, or .mov files.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-videos">Your videos:</h3>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU"
class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU</a>.</p>
<p>The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom is
here:</p>
<p><a

class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxJN6CQcXqIbOekDYMxjh7mTt1TyRVMl</a></p>
<p>Please send an email to the instructor (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered"
id="task-1-checking-the-consistency-of-two-regular-properties">Task 1:
Checking the consistency of two regular properties</h3>
<p>When we have a list of desired properties, it’s helpful to know
whether there are any examples that satisfy *all* of them at once; in
other words, whether the properties are consistent with each other. For
example, the properties of a string starting with <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and a string starting with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> are <span><em>not</em></span>
consistent, because there isn’t any example of a string that
simultaneously starts with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and
with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. In this part of the
project, you’ll use the decidability of the emptiness problem for DFA to
build an algorithm that checks if two given regular properties are
consistent.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that checks the consistency of two
arbitrary regular properties. The function input must be a
<span><strong>pair of strings</strong></span> and part of your work in
this program is to design string representations for any arbitrary DFA
since those DFAs will be how you represent the properties. The function
output must be a <span><strong>boolean</strong></span>: true (if the
pair of strings represent consistent regular properties) or false (if
the pair of strings do not represent consistent regular properties).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You might find it useful to use the algorithm for building a DFA
that recognizes the <span><strong>intersection</strong></span> of the
languages of two DFA and the algorithm for testing the
<span><strong>emptiness</strong></span> of the language of a
DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>One test case for your program is the following: Consider the DFA
<span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>and let <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span> be the string
representing <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> and let <span
class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> be the string representing <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>. Then the result of your program on
the input <span class="math inline">\(w_0, w_1\)</span> should be
<span><strong>false</strong></span> because the properties represented
by <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> are inconsistent.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The algorithm you implement needs to work with any pair of
strings given as input (you should first parse each string in the input
to see if it is formatted to represent a DFA). Your explanation of the
algorithm should be such that most programmers can replicate the
algorithm correctly. If you would like, you may use aids such as
co-pilot or ChatGPT to help you write this program. However, you should
test the code that is produced and be able to explain what it is doing.
Your code needs to be well-organized and well-documented. As a header in
your code file or as an appendix in your PDF submission, include a
comment block describing any resources that were used to help generate
your code, including any and all prompts used in interactions with LLM
coding tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, you will show how it runs (at least)
twice: once with the test input <span class="math inline">\(w_0,
w_1\)</span> described above, and once with test input <span
class="math inline">\(x_0, x_1\)</span> that you define to demonstrate
when the program outputs <span><strong>true</strong></span>. Your choice
of <span class="math inline">\(x_0, x_1\)</span> needs to satisfy the
following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> each represent DFA over the same
fixed alphabet,</p></li>
<li><p>the DFA represented by <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> do not recognize the same
language,</p></li>
<li><p>the DFA represented by <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> do not recognize the empty
set or the set of all strings or the set of all strings starting with
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or the set of all strings
starting with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of your demonstration, describe your choice of <span
class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, clearly specifying the DFAs they
represent and the languages recognized by these DFAs. Each demo run of
the program should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Side-by-side view of an English / mathematical formulation of the
properties and DFA corresponding to the demo run, along with their
string representation as input strings to the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Talk-aloud trace of the running of your program on the input pair
of strings representing the two properties for the demo. During the
trace, talk about the software design choices you made (e.g. which data
structures are you using, etc.) and how they impact the program. Also,
give credit to any resources you used to make these design choices or
develop the code.</p></li>
<li><p>Recording of actually running your program on the input pair of
strings for this demo, including interpreting the output the program
gives and connecting it to whether the properties represented by the
input are consistent or not.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span> For this task,
you will submit a PDF file plus a 3-5 minute video.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Submit a single PDF file that clearly describes the design
choices you made, includes all relevant code, and includes all relevant
information (definition, representation, justification) about the
examples used to demonstrate your program and screenshots from running
your program on the examples. The writeup should use precise language
and notation for all terms and clearly communicate the goal and approach
of your program.</p></li>
<li><p>The documentation for your program should include a description
of how input strings are parsed to represent DFA, in general and for the
specific examples of <span class="math inline">\(w_0, w_1, x_0,
x_1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The video should start with your face and your student ID visible
for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while
on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the rest of the video,
though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a brief confirmation
that it’s you creating the video and doing the work you
submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>The video includes the full program demo twice (once with the
input <span class="math inline">\(w_0,w_1\)</span> and once with the
input <span class="math inline">\(x_0,x_1\)</span>), and includes the a
mathematical and/or English definition of the regular properties you are
using, connected to their representations as strings when input to the
program, and the talk-aloud trace of running the program on these inputs
and its output connecting back to the notion of consistency of regular
properties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Clarity and brevity are both
important aspects of your video. In previous years, we’ve seen students
speed up their videos to get below the 5 minute upper bound. This is ok
so long as it doesn’t compromise clarity. If the graders need to slow
your video down to understand it, it may not earn full credit.</p>
<p><span><strong>Possible extensions</strong></span>: If you’re enjoying
working on this and want to go deeper, here are a few additions you can
consider. You will not be graded on any of these, and you should still
make sure your project has the core functionality described above, but
these extensions give you an opportunity to explore further.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build a preprocesing step so that the regular properties can be
expressed using NFA or regular expressions (in addition to DFA). You’ll
need to think about how to represent NFA and/or regular expressions as
strings, and then how to convert them to DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Extend your work so that your program can test for consistency of
more than two regular properties.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-2-illustrating-a-mapping-reduction">Task
2: Illustrating a mapping reduction</h3>
<p>We can use mapping reductions to prove that interesting computational
problems are undecidable, building on the undecidability of other
computational problems. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a
specific <span><strong>mapping reduction</strong></span> from an
undecidable language of your choice to <span
class="math display">\[EQ_{TM} = \{ \langle M_1, M_2 \rangle \mid M_1,
M_2 \text{ are Turing machines and } L(M_1) = L(M_2) \}\]</span> and
implement a computable function that witnesses it using a programming
language of your choice (aka a high-level description of a Turing
machine that computes it). You will then demonstrate how your
construction works for some test examples.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose an undecidable language (other than <span
class="math inline">\(EQ_{TM}\)</span>) that we discussed in class or in
the homework or in review quizzes or in the textbook . <span><em>Note:
if you’d like to consider an undecidable language we have not discussed
instead, please check with Prof. Minnes first. You must do so no later
than the start of Week 10.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that implements a computable
function witnessing this mapping reduction. The function input must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span> and the function output must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span>. Part of your work in this program
is to design string representations for arbitrary instances of the model
of computation the computational problems being compared in the mapping
reduction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may use our class material for ideas on the algorithm that
your program will implement. The algorithm you implement needs to be
general enough to decide whether each input string is in the language or
not. Your explanation of the algorithm should be such that most
programmers can replicate the algorithm correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT
to help you write this program. However, you should test the code that
is produced and be able to explain what it is doing. Your code needs to
be well-organized and well-documented. As a header in your code file or
as an appendix in your PDF submission, include a comment block
describing any resources that were used to help generate your code,
including any and all prompts used in interactions with LLM coding
tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, you will need to run it for an
example positive and negative instance. That is to say, if you are
implementing a computable function witnessing <span
class="math inline">\(X \leq_m EQ_{TM}\)</span>, you will select one
string that is in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and one string
that is not in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and you will
demonstrate running your program on each of these strings and explain
why the output of the function is good.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span> For this task,
you will submit a PDF file plus a 3-5 minute video.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Submit a single PDF file that clearly describes the mapping
reduction, including defining the undecidable language you chose and the
computable function that you will implement to witness its mapping
reduction to <span class="math inline">\(EQ_{TM}\)</span>, and includes
all relevant code and documentation documentation for the program
computing the function witnessing this mapping reduction. In particular,
include a description of how input strings are parsed and how output
strings correspond to input strings and a clear specification of your
two example strings, explaining which is is a positive instance (and
why) and which is a negative instance (and why not). The writeup should
use precise language and notation for all terms and clearly communicate
the goal and approach of your program.</p></li>
<li><p>The video should start with your face and your student ID visible
for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while
on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the rest of the video,
though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a brief confirmation
that it’s you creating the video and doing the work you
submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>The video includes the mapping reduction you will be working
with, and the example strings that you will be using, including
explanations of why you chose this reduction and these strings (and why
one of the strings is a positive instance and the other is a negative
instance). The full program demo should be part of the video, with an
explanation of the code and the software design choices you made and any
resources you used, and then live screencasts running your code on each
of your example inputs. Explain why the output of your program is what
you would expect, by connecting the output of the program to the
definition of the mapping reduction and your chosen parsing of input
strings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Clarity and brevity are both
important aspects of your video. In previous years, we’ve seen students
speed up their videos to get below the 5 minute upper bound. This is ok
so long as it doesn’t compromise clarity. If the graders need to slow
your video down to understand it, it may not earn full credit.</p>
