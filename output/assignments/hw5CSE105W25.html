<h1 class="title">HW5CSE105W25: Homework assignment 5</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W25</p>
<p class="date">Due: February 27th at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span> You will practice
analyzing, designing, and working with Turing machines. You will use
general constructions and specific machines to explore the classes of
recognizable and decidable languages. You will explore various ways to
encode machines as strings so that computational problems can be
recognized and solved.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 6, 7, and 8. We will
post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 3 exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8. Chapter
4 exercises 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>On the “graded for correctness" questions, you may only
collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group. You may ask questions
about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or
tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw5CSE105W25”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Equally expressive models</strong> (10 points): The
<span><strong>Church-Turing Thesis</strong></span> (Sipser p. 183) says
that the informal notion of algorithm is formalized completely and
correctly by the formal definition of a Turing machine. In other words:
all reasonably expressive models of computation are equally expressive
with the standard Turing machine. In this question, we will give support
for this thesis by showing that some adaptations of the standard
(Chapter 3) Turing machine model still gives us a new model that is
equally expressive.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Let’s define a new machine model, and call it the
<span><strong>May-stay</strong></span> machine. The May-stay machine
model is the same as the usual Turing machine model, except that on each
transition, the tape head may move L, move R, or Stay.</p>
<p>Formally: a May-stay machine is given by the <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((Q,
\Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a finite set with <span
class="math inline">\(q_0 \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_{accept} \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_{reject} \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> are alphabets and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\square \in \Gamma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\square \notin \Sigma\)</span>, and the transition
function has signature <span class="math display">\[\delta: Q \times
\Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R, S\}\]</span> The notions of
computation and acceptance are analogous to that from Turing
machines.</p>
<p>Prove that Turing machines and May-stay machines are equally
expressive. A complete proof will use the formal definitions of the
machines.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint: Include two directions of implications. First, let
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be an arbitrary Turing machine
and prove that there’s a May-stay machine that recognizes the language
recognized by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Next, let <span
class="math inline">\(M_S\)</span> be an arbitrary May-stay machine and
prove that there’s a Turing machine that recognizes the language
recognized by <span
class="math inline">\(M_S\)</span>.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Let’s define a new machine model, and call it the
<span><strong>Double-move</strong></span> machine. The Double-move
machine model is the same as the usual Turing machine model, except that
on each transition, the tape head may move L, move R one cell, or move R
two cells. Formally: a Double-move machine is given by the <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((Q,
\Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})\)</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is a finite set with <span
class="math inline">\(q_0 \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_{accept} \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_{reject} \in Q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> are alphabets and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\square \in \Gamma\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\square \notin \Sigma\)</span>, and the transition
function has signature <span class="math display">\[\delta: Q \times
\Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R, T\}\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> means that the read-write head moves to
the left one cell (or stays put if it’s at the leftmost cell already),
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> means that the read-write head
moves one cell to the right , and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>
means that the read-write head moves two cells to the right. The notion
of computation and acceptance are analogous to that from Turing
machines.</p>
<p>Prove that Turing machines and Double-move machines are equally
expressive. A complete proof will use the formal definitions of the
machines.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint: Include two directions of implications. First, let
<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be an arbitrary Turing machine
and prove that there’s a Double-move machine that recognizes the
language recognized by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Next, let
<span class="math inline">\(M_D\)</span> be an arbitrary Double-move
machine and prove that there’s a Turing machine that recognizes the
language recognized by <span
class="math inline">\(M_D\)</span>.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) In your proofs of
equal expressivity in the previous parts of this question, you proved
that a language is recognizable by some Turing machine if and only if it
is recognizable by some May-stay machine or by some Double-move machine.
Do your proofs also prove that a language is decidable by some Turing
machine if and only if it is decidable by some May-stay machine or by
some Double-move machine? Justify your answer.</p></li>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Suppose a friend

<p>Build a counterexample that could be used to convince your friend
that this construction doesn’t work. A complete counterexample will
include (1) a high-level description of <span

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Pick three of the
computational problems above and give examples (preferably different
from the ones we talked about in class) of strings that are in each of
the corresponding languages. Remember to use the notation <span
class="math inline">\(\langle \cdots \rangle\)</span> to denote the
string encoding of relevant objects. <span><em>Extension, not for
credit:</em></span> Explain why it’s hard to write a specific string of
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s and make a claim about membership in
one of these sets.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Computational
problems can also be defined for Turing machines. Consider the two
high-level descriptions of Turing machines below. Reverse-engineer them
to define the computational problem that is being recognized, where
<span class="math inline">\(L(M_{DFA})\)</span> is the language
corresponding to this computational problem about DFA and <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_{TM})\)</span> is the language corresponding
to this computational problem about Turing machines.
<span><em>Hint</em></span>: the computational problem is not acceptance,
language emptiness, or language equality (but is related to one of
them).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \ldots\)</span> be a list
of all strings in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in
string (shortlex) order. Consider the following Turing machines <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        M_{DFA} &amp;= ``\text{On input $\langle D \rangle$ where $D$ is
a DFA}:\\
         &amp;\text{1. for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$} \\
         &amp;\text{2.~~~ Run $D$ on $s_i$} \\
         &amp;\text{3.~~~~If it accepts, accept.}\\
         &amp;\text{4.~~~~If it rejects, go to the next iteration of the
loop&quot;}\\
     
\end{aligned}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        M_{TM} &amp;= ``\text{On input $\langle T \rangle$ where $T$ is
a Turing machine}:\\
         &amp;\text{1. for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$} \\
         &amp;\text{2.~~~ Run $T$ for $i$ steps on each input $s_1, s_2,
\ldots, s_i$ in turn} \\
         &amp;\text{3.~~~~If $T$ has accepted any of these, accept.}\\
         &amp;\text{4.~~~~Otherwise, go to the next iteration of the
loop&quot;}\\
