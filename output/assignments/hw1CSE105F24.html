<h1 class="title">HW1CSE105F24: Homework assignment 1</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105F24</p>
<p class="date">Due: October 8th at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying the definitions of alphabets,
strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions. You will use
regular expressions and relate them to languages and finite automata.
You will use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of
finite automata, and you will use clear English to describe computations
of finite automata informally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 0 and 1. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1. Chapter 1 exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.18,
1.23.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1CSE105F24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Finding examples and edge cases</strong> (12 points):</p>
<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma=
\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma
= \{0,1,2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F\}\)</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Give an example of a string over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> that is meaningful to you in some
way and whose length is between <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(20\)</span>, and explain why this string
is meaningful to you.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Calculate the
number of distinct strings of length 3 over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and then explain your
calculation.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) With the ordering
<span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 4&lt; 5&lt;
6&lt; 7 &lt; 8 &lt; 9&lt; A &lt; B &lt; C &lt; D&lt; E&lt; F\)</span>,
list the first 50 strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> in string order. Explain how you
constructed this list. <span><em>Note: you can write a program to
generate this list if you’d like, and you may use any external tools to
help you write this program. If you do use a program to generate the
list, include it (and documentation for how it works) as part of your
submission.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Give an example of a finite set that is a language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and over <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, or explain why there is no such
set. A complete and correct answer will use clear and precise notation
(consistent with the textbook and class notes) and will include a
description of why the given example is a language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and over <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> and is finite, or an explanation
why there is no such example.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Give an example of
an infinite set that is a language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and not over <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, or explain why there is no such
set. A complete and correct answer will use clear and precise notation
(consistent with the textbook and class notes) and will include a
description of why the given example is a language over <span

why there is no such example.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular expressions</strong> (10 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give three
regular expressions that all describe the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> that have odd length. Ungraded
bonus challenge: Make the expressions as different as possible!</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) A friend tells
you that each regular expression that has a Kleene star (<span
class="math inline">\(~^*\)</span>) describes an infinite language. Are
they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a
counterexample to disprove it and explain your counterexample.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Functions over languages</strong> (15 points):</p>
<p>For each language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we
have the associated sets of strings <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~

\in \Sigma_1^* \}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Specify an
example language <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(A) = EXTEND(A)\)</span>, or explain why
there is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(A)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND(A)\)</span> (using the given definitions)
to justify this description and to justify the set equality, or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
language <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(B) = \{\varepsilon\}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(B) = \Sigma_1^*\]</span> or explain why
there is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(B)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND(B)\)</span> (using the given definitions)
to justify this description and to justify the set equality with <span
class="math inline">\(\{\varepsilon\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1^*\)</span> (respectively), or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>

<span><strong>infinite</strong></span> language <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(C) \neq \Sigma_1^*\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(C) \neq \Sigma_1^*\]</span>, or explain
why there is no such example. A complete solution will include either
(1) a precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(B)\)</span>, <span

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Finite automata</strong> (13 points):</p>
<p>Consider the finite automaton <span class="math inline">\((Q, \Sigma,

<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) A friend tries to
summarize the transition function with the formula <span
class="math display">\[\delta(q_i,x) = \begin{cases}
            q_0 &amp;\text{ when $i=0$ and $x=0$} \\

        \end{cases}\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \in
\{0,1\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i \in
\{0,1,2\}\)</span>. Are they right? Either help them justify their claim
or give a counterexample to disprove it and then fix their
formula.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Give a regular
expression <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span> is the language recognized by this
finite automaton. Justify your answer by referring to the definition of
the semantics of regular expressions and computations of finite
automata. Include an explanation for why each string in <span
class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span> is accepted by the finite automaton
<span><em>and</em></span> for why each string not in <span
class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span> is rejected by the finite
automaton.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Keeping the same
set of states <span class="math inline">\(Q = \{q_0, q_1,
q_2\}\)</span>, alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma =
\{0,1\}\)</span>, same start state <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, and same transition function <span
class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>, choose a new set of accepting
states <span class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span> so that the new
finite automaton that results accepts at least one string that the
original one rejected <span><strong>and</strong></span> rejects at least
one string that the original one accepted, or explain why there is no
such choice of <span class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span>. A complete
solution will include either (1) a precise and clear description of your
choice of <span class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span> and a precise and
clear the two example strings using relevant definitions to justify
them, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no
such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
