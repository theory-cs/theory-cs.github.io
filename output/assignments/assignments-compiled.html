<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying the definitions of alphabets,
strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions. You will use
regular expressions and relate them to languages and automata. You will
use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of DFA, and
you will use clear English to describe computations of DFA
informally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 1. We
will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1. Chapter 1 exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.18,
1.23.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so

For <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> a set of strings over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, we can define the
following associated sets <span class="math display">\[LZ(L) = \{ 0^k w
\mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z}, k \geq 0 \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[TZ(L) = \{ w 0^k \mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z},
k \geq 0 \}\]</span></p>
<p>Note: the commas in the set-builder definition indicate “and”.</p>
<p>Note: <span class="math inline">\(0^k\)</span> is the result of
concatenating <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> with itself <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> times; it is the string of <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s.</p>
<p>Note: Formally, <span class="math inline">\(LZ\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(TZ\)</span> are each functions, with domain the
set of languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and
with codomain the set of languages over <span

of the result of computing <span class="math inline">\(LZ(L_1)\)</span>
using the definitions to justify this description and justifying the set
equality with <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>, or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify an example language <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> where <span

(01)^*~)
\qquad \qquad
R_2 = (~(000)^*(111)^* (\varepsilon \cup 0\cup1))\]</span> You will
prove that <span class="math display">\[L(R_1) \not \subseteq L(R_2) ~
\text{and} ~ L(R_2) \not \subseteq L(R_1)  
~ \text{and} ~ L(R_1) \cap L(R_2)  \neq \emptyset
~ \text{and} ~ L(R_1) \cup L(R_2)  \neq \Sigma^*\]</span> by giving four
example strings that witness these properties.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Specify an example string <span
class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w_1 \in L(R_1) \cap L(R_2)\)</span>. Briefly

<li><p>Pick a four letter alphabet (a nonempty finite set), and specify
it, e.g. by filling in the blank <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma

<p>Then, pick a language of cardinality (size) <span

<span><em>Note: we encourage you to pay attention to syntax here. There
are many correct answers; please be precise in how you present the sets

<li><p>Give a regular expression that describes the language <span

justify why your regular expression works.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a DFA that recognizes your language <span

DFA <span><strong>both</strong></span> using a formal definition
<span><strong>and</strong></span> a state diagram. Briefly justify why
your DFA works.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Consider the DFA
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> given by the state diagram

<figcaption>State diagram for DFA <span

</figure>
<p>Suppose someone tells you that the formal definition of this DFA is
<span class="math display">\[(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F) =  (\{ q0, q1,
q2, q3, q4, q5 \}, \{0,1,2\}, \delta, q0, q0)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q\)</span> is given by
<span class="math display">\[\hspace{-1in}\delta ( (q, 0) ) =
\begin{cases}
q5 &amp; \text{if $q=q0$} \\
qj &amp; \text{if $q=qi$ and $i \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $j=i+1$} \\
q &amp; \text{if $q \in \{q4,q5\}$} \\
\end{cases}  \qquad \delta ( (q, 1) ) = \begin{cases}
    q1 &amp; \text{if $q=q0$} \\
    q5 &amp; \text{if $q \in \{q1,q4,q5\}$} \\
    \delta( (q,0) ) &amp; \text{if $q=q2$ or $q=q3$} \\
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Confirm that this formal description is correct (in that it is
consistent with the state diagram), or fix any and all mistakes in it.
In your solution, explicitly address whether the description of the set
of states is correct, whether the description of the alphabet is
correct, whether the description of the transition function is correct,
whether the description of the start state is correct, and whether the
description of the accept states is correct, and why.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the set of accept states of this state diagram to get a
different DFA (with the same set of states, alphabet, start state, and
transition function) that recognizes an infinite language. Your solution
should include the diagram of this new DFA and an explanation of why the
language it recognizes is infinite.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Which
of the following are valid descriptions using the terminology we have
used in class and in the book so far? For those that aren’t, explain
what’s wrong. For those that are, give an example of what’s being
described.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A finite automaton accepts a regular expression.</p></li>
<li><p>The language described by a regular expression is a finite
automaton.</p></li>
<li><p>The empty string is the language of some regular
expression.</p></li>
<li><p>A string of length one uses one symbol from the
alphabet.</p></li>
<li><p>The input string runs a finite automaton.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>

Over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span>, consider
the language <span class="math display">\[L = \{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid
(ab \textrm{ is a substring of $w$}) \land (ba \textrm{ is a substring

will use two different approaches to proving that this language is
regular by building (different) DFA that recognize this language.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Design a DFA recognizing the language <span
class="math inline">\(\{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid ab \textrm{ is a substring
of $w$}\}\)</span> and a DFA recognizing the language <span

a\}\)</span>. Then, use the construction we discussed in class to
combine these DFA to get a DFA that recognizes <span

(clearly labelled) state diagrams for each of the three building-block
DFAs, along with a description of the result of combining these DFAs

<li><p>To safeguard the privacy or security of a network, some software
filters the IP addresses that are allowed to send content to computers
on the network. Each IP address can be broken into parts that represent
the source host of incoming traffic, including geographic data. As a
result, software needs to be designed to recognize whether certain
substrings (representing permitted hosts) are present (if the hosts are
permitted to send data) and whether others are absent (if those hosts
are blocked from sending data).</p>
<p>In this question, you’ll design ways to detect these patterns in
strings.</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p>In this question, you’ll practice working with formal general
constructions for DFAs and translating between state diagrams and formal
definitions. Consider the following construction in the textbook for
Chapter 1 Problem 34, which we include here for reference: “Let <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{ 0,1\}\)</span>. Define <span
class="math display">\[B \overset{1}{\leftarrow} C= \{ w \in B
~\mid~\textrm{ for some $y \in C$, strings $w$ and $y$ contain equal
numbers of $1$s }\}\]</span> The class of regular languages is shown to
be closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(\overset{1}{\leftarrow}\)</span> operation using
the construction: Let <span class="math inline">\(M_B = (Q_B, \Sigma,
\delta_B, q_B, F_B)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_C = (
Q_C, \Sigma, \delta_C, q_C, F_C)\)</span> be DFAs recognizing the
languages <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, respectively. We will now construct
NFA <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(B \overset{1}{\leftarrow}
C\)</span> as follows. To decide whether its input <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is in <span class="math inline">\(B
\overset{1}{\leftarrow} C\)</span>, the machine <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> checks that <span
class="math inline">\(w \in B\)</span>, and in parallel
nondeterministically guesses a string <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that contains the same number of <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s as contained in <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and checks that <span
class="math inline">\(y \in C\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Q = Q_B \times Q_C\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For <span class="math inline">\((q,r) \in Q\)</span> and <span

\\
\{ (q, \delta_C( r,0 ))\}  \qquad&amp;\textrm{if } a = \varepsilon\\

F_C\)</span>   ."</p></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Illustrate this
construction by defining specific example DFAs <span
class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_C\)</span> and including their state diagrams in
your submission. Choose <span class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> to have
four states and <span class="math inline">\(M_C\)</span> to have two
states, and make sure that every state in each state diagram is
reachable from the start state of that machine. Apply the construction
above to create the NFA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and
include its state diagram in your submission. <span><em>Note: you may
include the formal definition of your DFAs and NFA, but this is not
required.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Hint: Confirm that you have specified every required piece
of the state diagram for <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. E.g.,

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) In
last week’s homework, we saw the definitions of two functions on the set
of languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>: for
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> a set of strings over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, we can define the
following associated sets <span class="math display">\[LZ(L) = \{ 0^k w

class="math display">\[TZ(L) = \{ w 0^k \mid w \in L, k \in \mathbb{Z},
k \geq 0 \}\]</span> In this question, we’ll develop a general
construction that will prove that if <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular then so are <span
class="math inline">\(LZ(L)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(TZ(L)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider an arbitrary regular language <span

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice distinguishing between regular and nonregular
languages using both closure arguments and the pumping lemma. You will
also practice with the definition of pushdown automata.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are
working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 2
through Week 4. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers
to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 1.4, 2.2. Chapter 1 exercises 1.29, 1.30. Chapter 1
problems 1.49, 1.50, 1.51. Chapter 2 exercises 2.5, 2.7.</p>
<p><span><strong>Key Concepts</strong></span>: Pumping lemma, pumping
length, regular languages, nonregular languages, pushdown automata,
stack.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your
group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours
(of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes
viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online
resources about the course content other than the class material from
this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent
notation and definitions we will use this quarter and also to protect
the learning experience you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving
the problem authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a

<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span

Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span

class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span

class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span

have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span>. Since <span

<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3
students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The
lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please
ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of
your homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If
working in a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner
uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds
the other group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting
their name(s) in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to
re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of
your assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for
correctness (including clear and precise explanations and justifications
of all answers) or fair effort completeness. You may only collaborate on
HW with CSE 105 students in your group; if your group has questions
about a HW problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In this question,
you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for PDAs and
translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math display">\[M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta,
q_0, F)\]</span> is a PDA. We can define a new PDA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(M) = L(N)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is <span><strong>guaranteed to have an
empty stack</strong></span> at the end of any accepting computation.
Informally, the construction is as follows: Add three new states <span
class="math inline">\(q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\)</span> and one new
stack symbol <span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the new states <span
class="math inline">\(q_1&#39;\)</span> will be the new
<span><strong>start</strong></span> state and it has a spontaneous
transition to the old start state <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> which pushes the new stack symbol
<span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span> to the stack.</p></li>
<li><p>The transitions between the old states are all the same.</p></li>
<li><p>From each of the old accept states,
<span><strong>add</strong></span> a spontaneous transition (that doesn’t
modify the stack) to the second new state <span
class="math inline">\(q_2&#39;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>In this state <span class="math inline">\(q_2&#39;\)</span>, pop
all old stack symbols from the stack without reading any input.</p></li>
<li><p>When the new stack symbol <span class="math inline">\(\#\)</span>
is on the top of the stack, transition to the third new state <span
class="math inline">\(q_3&#39;\)</span> and accept.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\{ q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\}
\cap Q = \emptyset\)</span> (otherwise, relabel some of the states in
<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>) and assume that <span
class="math inline">\(\# \notin \Gamma\)</span> (otherwise, relabel this
stack symbol in <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>). Define
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to be <span
class="math display">\[N = ( Q \cup \{ q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\} ,
\Sigma, \Gamma \cup \{\#\}, \delta_N, q_1&#39;, \{q_3&#39;\} )\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\delta_N : Q \cup \{ q_1&#39;,
q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\}~~\times~~ \Sigma_\varepsilon
~~\times~~\Gamma_\varepsilon\cup \{\#\}
\to \mathcal{P}( Q \cup \{ q_1&#39;, q_2&#39;, q_3&#39;\} ~~\times
~~\Gamma_\varepsilon\cup \{\#\})\)</span> is defined as <span
class="math display">\[\delta_N ( ~(q, x, y)~) = \begin{cases}
\{ (q_0, \#) \} &amp;\qquad \text{if $q = q_1&#39;$, $x = \varepsilon$,

\delta( ~(q, x, y)~)  &amp; \qquad \text{if $q \in Q$, $x \in \Sigma$,
$y \in \Gamma_\varepsilon$} \\

$y \in \Gamma$} \\
\delta( ~(q, x, y)~)  &amp; \qquad \text{if $q \in Q  \setminus F$,
$x=\varepsilon$, $y =\varepsilon$} \\

<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Illustrate this

<div class="center">

</div>
<p>and applying the construction above to create the related PDA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and include its state diagram in your
submission. <span><em>Note: you may include the formal definition of
your PDA, but this is not required.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Pick a string of

empty at the end of the computation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In your descriptions of these computations, include both the sequence
of states visited by the machine as well as snapshots of the full
contents of the stack at each step in the computation. You may hand-draw
and scan these traces of the computations.</p>
<p><span><em>Hint</em></span>: You will need to pick your example string
wisely. It must be accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
and there must be a computation of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on your string which ends with a
nonempty stack. Not all choices of length <span

class="math inline">\(L_1 = L(M_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L_2 = L(M_2)\)</span>, then there is a PDA that
recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L_1 \circ L_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that, for any languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1,
L_2\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, if there

</ol></li>
<li><p>Consider the Turing machine <span

<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p><span><em>Why?</em></span> TBA</p>
<p><span><em>How?</em></span> During emergency remote instruction last
academic year, we discovered that video assessement and some open-ended
personalized projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for
students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission
also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p>Your videos: We will delete all the videos we receive from you after
assigning final grades for the course, and they will be stored in a
university-controlled Google Drive directory only accessible to the
course staff during the quarter. Please send an email to the instructor
(minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast
components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for
some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h2>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 20 offering (notes, readings,
class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than
enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere
online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources
you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them). Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator and the reason
you consulted this reference. The work you submit for the project needs
to be your own. Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than
this quarter’s material and doing so may result in definitions or
notations that conflict with our norms in this class so think carefully
before you go down this path.</p>
<p>The project has three parts.</p>

<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video that starts with your face and
your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce
yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the
rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a
brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and doing the work
submitted for the project.</p>
<p>Then, explain your work in question 1 of the written component.
Discuss at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar
question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking
about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might
struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>

<h2 id="task-2-closure-of-the-collection-of-regular-languages">Task 2:
Closure of the Collection of Regular Languages</h2>
<p>For this task, we fix <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma =
\{0,1\}\)</span>. Recall that the composition of two functions <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(f \circ g\)</span>, which can also be written as
<span class="math inline">\(f(g(x))\)</span>, and is the result of first
applying the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> to the
input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (producing <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>), and then applying <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span>. Below are some functions with
domain and codomain <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)\)</span>; that is, they each
take in a language over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and
output a language over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        TZ(L) &amp;= \{ w0^k \mid w \in L, k \geq 0 \}\\
        R(L) &amp;= \{ w \mid w^R \in L\} \textrm{(where $w^R$ is
reversing $w$, e.g. $(100)^R = 001$)}\\
        E(L) &amp;= \{ w \mid w \in L, \textrm{ the length of $w$ is
even} \} \\
        T(L) &amp;= \{ w \mid w \in L, \textrm{ the length of $w$ is a
multiple of } 3 \}\\
        EQ(L) &amp;= \{ w^k1^k \mid k \geq 0, w \in L \} \textrm{(where
$w^k$ is concatenating $w$ with itself $k$ times, e.g. $(100)^2 =
100100$)}\\
        LT(L) &amp;= \{ w^k1^j \mid 0 \leq k &lt; j , w \in L \}\\
        EQ2(L) &amp;= \{ w^kx^k \mid k \geq 0, w \in L, x \in L \}
    
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>For example <span class="math inline">\((TZ \circ R)(L) = TZ(R(L)) =
\{ w^R 0^k | w \in L, k \geq 0\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose two functions from the above list so that their
composition, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, is such that the
collection of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Provide a clear and complete definition of your function <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. A complete solution will clearly
specify the two functions you chose to compose, the order in which <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> applies them, and a general description
of what the function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> does using
set builder descriptions and/or English prose.
<span><strong>Note:</strong></span> You do not need to apply <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> to a language in this step, you only
need to define <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that the collection of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span> by writing out the following argument
in detail: Consider an arbitrary regular language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0, 1\}\)</span>. Since it is regular,
it is recognized by a DFA and let <span class="math inline">\(M = (Q,
\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span> be such a DFA over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(M) = L\)</span>. Give the formal construction of
an NFA <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(L(N) = h(L)\)</span> for your function <span
class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. Briefly justify this construction by
tracing the computations of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>
and/or referencing constructions we discussed in class and in the book.
In particular, explain the role of each parameter in the definition of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in the construction.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Choose two functions from the above list so that their
composition, <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>, is such that
the collection of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>. <span><em>Note the functions you
choose for this part may or may not overlap with those from the previous
part; it’s up to you to decide.</em></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Provide a clear and complete definition of your function <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>. A complete solution will clearly
specify the two functions you chose to compose, the order in which <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> applies them, and a general
description of what the function <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> does using set builder
descriptions and/or English prose.</p></li>
<li><p>Give a witness language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>
that can be used to prove that the class of regular languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> is not closed under <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span>. To do so: (1) clearly define a
language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, (2) prove that <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular, and (3) prove that <span
class="math inline">\(h&#39;(L)\)</span> is not regular. You may use
results proved in class and / or the relevant sections in the textbook
as part of your proofs if you would like, but you must label these
results and provide references to the day we discussed them and/or the
page number in the book.</p></li>

<h2 id="task-3-implementation-examples-and-video">Task 3: Implementation
examples and Video</h2>
<p>With the introduction of PDAs, our models of computation begin to
approach the power that modern day computers have. Choose a specific
non-regular but context-free language mentioned in some question in the
review quizzes between 4/15/22 (Friday of Week 3) to 4/29/22 (Friday of
Week 5); you will write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, or C++
which is able to test membership of strings in that language. The
program you write should function like a PDA, using a constant amount of
memory plus access to a stack, and should only make a single pass
through the string.</p>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. Create a
3-5 minute screencast video with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you
are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the
video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>State which language you chose from the review quiz, and show the
state diagram for a PDA which recognizes the language, briefly
justifying why it works.</p></li>
<li><p>State which programming language you chose to use and show on the
screen all the code your wrote to implement the PDA in your chosen
programming language. Discuss how the behavior of your program is
related to the state diagram of the PDA, and discuss the implementation
choices you made when creating this program.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate 4 test cases (2 strings in the language recognized by
your PDA, 2 strings not in this language), clearly defining each one,
explaining the expected behavior of the PDA, and showing the output /
feedback your program gives to indicate whether the expected behavior
matches the actual behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this video along with a written version of Tasks 1
and 2 to Gradescope.</p>
<p><span><strong>Extra exploration (not for credit)</strong></span>:
What would it take to implement context-free grammars in code? Could you
use any of your work from implementaing PDAs?</p>
<h1 id="grading-criteria-and-checklists">Grading Criteria and
checklists</h1>
<p><span><strong>Task 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Submission covers a complete review quiz question from the relevant
weeks (all parts of the question must be addressed for multi-part
questions).</p>
<p>Submission clearly labels review questions, including which day it’s
from and the problem description.</p>
<p>Submission includes why the student picked the problem/ what they
found interesting.</p>
<p>Solution is written (or typed) out in detail step-by-step, with clear
and correct logic and justification.</p>
<p>Submission includes 2 potential mistakes that a student might make
while solving this question and explains why they are wrong.</p>
<p><span><strong>Task 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Question 1</em></span>:</p>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is described
clearly and completely, using appropriate notation and terminology.</p>
<p>The formal construction of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is
clear, correct, and complete, and is justified appropriately and
correctly.</p>
<p><span><em>Question 2</em></span>:</p>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;\)</span> is described
clearly and completely, using appropriate notation and terminology.</p>
<p>The language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is specified
clearly and completely and is a viable witness for the proof.</p>
<p>The proof that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is regular is
clear, correct, and complete.</p>
<p>The proof that <span class="math inline">\(h&#39;(L)\)</span> is not
regular is clear, correct, and complete.</p>
<p><span><strong>Task 3</strong></span></p>
<p>Logistics Items</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Video loads correctly</p></li>
<li><p>Video is between 3 and 5 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Video shows the student’s face and ID, and they introduce
themself audibly while on screen</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The video clearly states which language was chosen for study, and
references a specific review quiz with this language.</p>
<p>The video shows the state diagram of a PDA which recognizes the
chosen language.</p>
<p>The video clearly describes which programming language was chosen for
the implementaiton and gives the reasons why.</p>
<p>The video discusses the connections between the state diagram of the
PDA and its implementation in the code.</p>
<p>The video clearly demonstrates all test cases, including both
expected and actual output. The video should include screencasts of
running the code live to demonstrate these test cases.</p>
<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to
extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your
choosing.</p>
<p>Why? To go deeper and explore the material from Theory of Computation
and how it relates to other aspects of CS and beyond.</p>
<p>How? During emergency remote instruction last academic year, we
discovered that video assessment and some open-ended personalized
projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for students
than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission also gives
flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p><span><strong>Your videos</strong></span>: We will delete all the
videos we receive from you after assigning final grades for the course,
and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive
directory only accessible to the course staff during the quarter. Please
send an email to the instructor (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here: <a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU">Tutorial

is here: <a

produced in tutorial</a> .</p>
<p><span><strong>What resources can you use?</strong> </span> This
project must be completed individually, without any help from other
people, including the course staff (other than logistics support if you
get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 105
offering (notes, readings, class videos, supplementary videos, homework
feedback). You may additionally search online to respond to project
parts that explicitly ask you to do so, and you must cite all resources
(online or offline) that you consult as part of this search. Link
directly to the resource and include the name of the author / video
creator and the reason you consulted this reference. The work you submit
for the project needs to be your own.</p>
<p>The written portion of the project is expected to be clearly legible,
and should preferably be typed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select one question from one of the review quizzes from 5/2/22
(Monday of Week 6) to 5/27/22 (Friday of Week 9) to revisit. Include the
problem description, why you picked this question (e.g. what is
interesting about it, what is hard about it, or why you wanted to take a
second look at it), and your solution. Question selection: you can pick
any one question listed in the Gradescope review quizzes, and you must
address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete
solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about
the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the
correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas
clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be
to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine
you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 105 who
missed that week and is “catching up”.</p></li>
<li><p>Include at least 2 potential mistakes that a student may have
made while attempting to solve the quiz problem that you selected.
Explain why the reasoning behind these mistakes is flawed so that a
student reading this may learn from these mistakes. It’s a good idea to
include mistakes that you made when you first tried to solve this
problem!</p></li>

<p>If you get stuck:</p>
<p>We want you to demonstrate your knowledge about mapping reductions in
this part of the project. As professionals, it’s important to realize
when we don’t know or unsure about something. In grading your work on
this part of the project, some partial credit will be available for
partial correct progress on the task and then explanations of where you
got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="task-3-video-about-computable-functions">Task
