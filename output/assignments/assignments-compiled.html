<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>

<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Strings and languages: finding examples and edge
cases</strong> (12 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Give five (different) example alphabets that are meaningful or useful to
you in some way. Specify them formally, either with roster notation
(which means listing all and only distict elements between <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span> and separated by commas) or with
another approach to precisely define all and only the elements of the
alphabet.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give an example
of a finite set over an alphabet and an infinite set over an alphabet.
You get to choose the alphabet, and you get to choose the sets. The goal
is to practice communicating your choices and definitions with clear and
precise notation. One habit that will be useful (for this course, and
beyond), is to think of your response for each question as a well-formed
paragraph: include all the information that is relevant so that your
solution is self-contained, and so that each sentence is grammatically
constructed.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Define an alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> and an
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and a language
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> that is also a language over
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and a language <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> that is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> a language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span>. A complete and correct answer
will use clear and precise notation (consistent with the textbook and
class notes) and will include a description of why the given example
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is a language over both <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and a description of why the
given example <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> is a language
over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and not over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular expressions</strong> (20 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give three
regular expressions that all describe the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> that have odd length. Ungraded
bonus challenge: Make the expressions as different as possible!</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) A friend tells
you that each regular expression that has a Kleene star (<span
class="math inline">\(~^*\)</span>) describes an infinite language. Are
they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a
counterexample to disprove it and explain your counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) For this question,
the alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>. A friend
is trying to design a regular expression that describes the set of all
strings over this alphabet that end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Classify each of the following
attempts as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correct. Explain why.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Type 1: Incorrect, because (even though each string that is
in the language described by the regular expression ends in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>) there is a string that ends in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> that is not in the language described
by the regular expression. Give this example string and explain why it
proves we’re in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Type 2: Incorrect, because (even though each string that
ends in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in the language
described by the regular expression), there is a string in the language
described by the regular expression that does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Give this example string and explain
why it proves we’re in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Type 3: Incorrect, because there are two counterexample
strings, one which is a string that ends in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> that is not in the language described
by the regular expression and one which is in the language described by
the regular expression but does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.Give both example strings and describe
why each has the given property.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Worked example for reference:</em></span> Consider the
regular expression <span class="math inline">\((a\cup b\cup
c)^*\)</span>. This regular expression has <span><strong>Error Type
2</strong></span> because it describes the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>, so even though each string
that ends in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in this language,
there is an example, say <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span> that is
a string in the language described by the regular expression (because we
consider the string formed as a result of the Kleene star operation
which has 2 slots and where the first slot matches the <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(a \cup b
\cup c\)</span> and the second slot matches <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(a \cup b
\cup c\)</span>) but does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (it ends in <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>).</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>The regular expression is <span class="math display">\[(a\cup
b)^* \circ c\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The regular expression is <span class="math display">\[(a \circ b
\circ c)^*\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The regular expression is <span class="math display">\[a^*c
~\cup~ b^*c ~\cup~ c^*c\]</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Functions over languages</strong> (18 points):</p>
<p>For each language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over an
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the
associated sets of strings (also over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span class="math display">\[L^*
= \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in
L\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in
\Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy
\in L\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in
\Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in
\Sigma^* \}\]</span> Also, recall the set operations union and
intersection: for any sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <span class="math display">\[X
\cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y
\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Specify an
example language <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(A) = EXTEND(A)\]</span> or explain why
there is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(A)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND(A)\)</span> (using the given definitions)
to justify this description and to justify the set equality, or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
language <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(B) \cap EXTEND(B) =
\{\varepsilon\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(B)
\cup EXTEND(B) = \{0,1\}^*\]</span> or explain why there is no such
example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear
description of your example language <span

the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(B)\)</span>, <span

to justify this description and to justify the set equality with <span
class="math inline">\(\{\varepsilon\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> (respectively), or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
<span><strong>infinite</strong></span> language <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(C) \neq \{0,1\}^*\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(C) = C^*\]</span>or explain why there
is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(C)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> (using the given definitions) to
justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims, or
(2) a sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such
example, referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
<span><strong>finite</strong></span> language <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(D) \neq \{0,1\}^*\]</span> and <span

the result of computing <span class="math inline">\(EXTEND(D)\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(D^*\)</span> (using the given definitions)

automata. Include an explanation for why each string in <span

<li><p><strong>Automata design</strong> (12 points): As background to
this question, recall that integers can be represented using base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansions, for any convenient choice
of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The precise definition
is: for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> an integer greater than
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Design a DFA that
recognizes the set of binary (base <span

are powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. A complete
solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief
justification of your construction by explaining the role each state
plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the
strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified
language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) A power of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is an integer <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(2^y\)</span> for some nonnegative integer <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, (2) the DFA should accept the strings
<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(100000\)</span> and should reject the strings
<span class="math inline">\(010\)</span>, <span

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Design a DFA that
recognizes the set of binary (base <span

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Find a positive
integer <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> greater than <span

the set of base <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> expansions of
positive integers that are less than <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span> and it uses as few states as possible.
A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a

recognizes the language <span class="math display">\[L_2 = \{w \in

class="math inline">\(abca\)</span> are each elements of this language
but <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(abb\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(abbc\)</span> are not elements of this
language.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and a

<li><p><strong>General constructions</strong> (13 points): In this
question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for
automata and translating between state diagrams and formal

<p>Recall the definitions of operations we’ve talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language <span

strings (also over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span

<span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv
\text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^*

any sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
