<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying the definitions of alphabets,
strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions. You will use
regular expressions and relate them to languages and finite automata.
You will use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of
finite automata, and you will use clear English to describe computations
of finite automata informally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 1. We will post

class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>

</ol>
<p><span><em>Bonus extension to think about (ungraded):</em></span>
Which other languages related to sets of integers can be proved to be
regular using a similar strategy?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple representations</strong> (10 points): For any
language <span class="math inline">\(L \subseteq \Sigma^*\)</span>,
recall that we define its <em>complement</em> as <span
class="math display">\[\overline{L} := \Sigma^* - L = \{w \in \Sigma^*
\mid w \notin L\}\]</span> That is, the complement of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> contains all and only those strings
which are not in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Our notation
for regular expressions does not include the complement symbol. However,
it turns out that the complement of a language described by a regular
expression is guaranteed to also be describable by a (different) regular
expression. For example, over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>, the complement of the
language described by the regular expression <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma^* 0\)</span> is described by the regular
expression <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \cup
\Sigma^*1\)</span> because any string that does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> must either be the empty string or end
in <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>For each of the regular expressions <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{a,b\}\)</span> below, write the regular
expression for <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>.
Your regular expressions may use the symbols <span
class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the following operations to
combine them: union, concatenation, and Kleene star.</p>
<p>Briefly justify why your solution for each part works by giving plain
English descriptions of the language described by the regular expression
and of its complement and connecting them to the regular expression via
relevant definitions. An English description that is more detailed than
simply negating the description in the original language will likely be
helpful in the justification.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can justify your solution by first designing a DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span>, using the
construction from class and the book to modify this DFA to get a new DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>,
and then applying the constructions from class and the book to convert
this new DFA to a regular expression.</p>
<p>For each part of the question, clearly state which approach you’re
taking and include enough intermediate steps to illustrate your
work.</p>

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Applying general constructions</strong> (12 points): In
this question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions
for NFAs and translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.
Consider the following general construction: Let <span
class="math inline">\(N_1 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> be
a NFA and assume that <span class="math inline">\(q_0 \notin Q\)</span>.
Define the new NFA <span class="math inline">\(N_2 = (Q \cup \{q_0\},
\Sigma, \delta_2, q_0, \{q_1\})\)</span> where <span
class="math display">\[\delta_2: (Q \cup \{q_0\}) \times
\Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P} (Q \cup \{q_0\})\]</span> is defined
by <span class="math display">\[\delta_2 (q,a) = \begin{cases}
        \{ q&#39; \in Q \mid q \in \delta_1(q&#39;,a)\} &amp;\text{if $q
\in Q$, $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$} \\
        F_1 &amp;\text{if $q =q_0$, $a = \varepsilon$}\\
        \emptyset &amp;\text{if $q = q_0$, $a \in \Sigma$}
    \end{cases}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Illustrate this
construction by defining a specific example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and applying the construction above to
create a new NFA. Your example NFA should</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have exactly three states (all reachable from the start
state),</p></li>
<li><p>Have at least one spontaneous move (arrow labelled <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>),</p></li>
<li><p>Accept at least one string and reject at least one string,
and</p></li>
<li><p>Not have any states labelled <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the construction above to create the new NFA. A complete
submission will include the state diagram of your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the state diagram of the NFA
resulting from this construction.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Use Theorem 1.39
on page 55 of the book (see also page 7 in Week 3 notes) to construct a
DFA equivalent to your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> from part (a). A complete submission
will include the state diagram of your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the state diagram of the DFA
resulting from this construction, with the correct state labels for this
DFA. You may prune the DFA so that only the “macro-states” reachable
from the start state are included.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Explain the
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> in the general construction. Give an
example string that is accepted by your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and is rejected by the NFA that results
from applying the general construction that illustrates this
relationship, or explain why there is no such example string.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Pumping</strong> (8 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Give an example of
a language over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> that has cardinality <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and for which <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is a pumping length and <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is not a pumping length. A complete
solution will give a clear and precise description of the language, a
justification for why <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is a
pumping length, and a justification for why <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> is not a pumping length. Is this
language regular?</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Consider the
following attempted “proof" that the set <span class="math display">\[X
= \{ uw \mid \text{$u$ and
$w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}\]</span> is
nonregular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^p 0^p\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and has length greater than or equal to
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
ought to be pump’able. That is, there should be a way of dividing <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into parts <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in X\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are such that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.
Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy|
\leq p\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are made up of all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. If we let <span
class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> because repeating <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and strings in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are required to have <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be the same length. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we have demonstrated
that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has no pumping length. By
the Pumping Lemma, this implies that <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is nonregular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Find the (first and/or most significant) logical error in the “proof"
and describe why it’s wrong. Then, either prove that the set is actually
regular (by finding a regular expression that describes it or a DFA/NFA
that recognizes it, and justifying why) <span><strong>or</strong></span>
fix the proof so that it is logically sound.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) In class and in
the reading so far, we’ve seen the following examples of nonregular
sets:</p>
<div class="multicols">
<p><span>3</span></p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 0 \}\)</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 2 \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~  0 \leq n \leq m \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~ 0 \leq m \leq n \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^i 1^{2i} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^i 1^{i+1} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ 0^n 1^m 0^n ~|~n,m \geq 0\}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* ~|~w = w^R\}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[\{ w w^R ~|~ w \in \{0,1\}^*\}\]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Modify one of these sets in some way and use the Pumping Lemma to
prove that the resulting set is still nonregular.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular and nonregular languages</strong> (8 points): In
Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Prove or disprove each closure claim statement below about the class
of regular languages and the class of nonregular languages. Your
arguments may refer to theorems proved in the textbook and class, and if
they do, should include specific page numbers and references (i.e. write
out the claim that was proved in the book and/or class).</p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have:</p>
<p>For languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we
have the associated sets of strings <span

\text{there exist } a,b \in \Sigma_1^* \text{ such that } awb \in

\in L_2 \}\]</span></p>

<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Remember that the
definition of set-wise concatenation is: for languages <span

F_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma,
\Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset\)</span>, define <span
class="math inline">\(Q = Q_1 \cup Q_2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Gamma = \Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_2\)</span>, and
<span class="math display">\[M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_1,
F_2)\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\delta: Q \times
\Sigma_\varepsilon \times \Gamma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q \times
\Gamma_\varepsilon)\)</span> given by <span
class="math display">\[\delta( q,a,b) = \begin{cases}
        \delta_1 (q,a,b) &amp;\text{if $q \in Q_1 \setminus F_1$, $a \in
\Sigma_\varepsilon$, $b \in {\Gamma_1}_\varepsilon$} \\
        \delta_2 (q,a,b) &amp;\text{if $q \in Q_2$, $a \in

        \emptyset &amp;\text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\]</span> Apply this construction to the machines <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> from part (a), and then use the
resulting PDA to prove that <span><em>this</em></span> construction
cannot be used to prove that the class of context-free languages is
closed under set-wise concatenation. A complete solution will include
(1) the state diagram of the machine <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that results from applying this
construction to <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, (2) an example of a string that is
accepted by this PDA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> but that is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> in the language <span
class="math inline">\(A_1 \circ A_2\)</span> with a description of the
computation that witnesses that this string is accepted by <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and an explanation of why this string
is not in <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \circ A_2\)</span> by
referring back to the definitions of <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>, and set-wise concatenation.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular languages are context-free</strong> (10
points):</p>
<p>Informally, we think of regular languages as potentially simpler than
context-free languages. In this question, you’ll make this precise by
showing that every regular language is context-free, in two ways.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) When we first
introduced PDAs we saw that any NFA can be transformed to a PDA by not
using the stack of the PDA at all. Make this precise by completing the
following construction: Given a NFA <span class="math inline">\(N = (Q,
\Sigma, \delta_N, q_0, F)\)</span> we define a PDA <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(L(M) =
L(N)\)</span> by choosing … A complete solution will have precise,
correct definitions for each of the defining parameters of <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span>: the set of states, the input alphabet,
the stack alphabet, the transition function, the start state, and the
set of accept states. Be careful to use notation that matches the types
of the objects involved.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In the book on
page 107, the top paragraph describes a procedure for converting DFA to
CFGs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can convert any DFA into an equivalent CFG as follows. Make a
variable <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> for each state <span
class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> of the DFA. Add the rule <span
class="math inline">\(R_i \to aR_j\)</span> to the CFG if <span
class="math inline">\(\delta(q_i,a) =q_j\)</span> is a transition in the
DFA. Add the rule <span class="math inline">\(R_i\to
\varepsilon\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is an
accept state of the DFA. Make <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>
the start variable ofthe grammar, where <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> is the start state of the machine.
Verify on your own that the resulting CFG generates the same language
that the DFA recognizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use this construction to get a context-free grammar generating the
language <span class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid w \text{
does not have $11$ as a substring}\}\]</span> by (1) designing a DFA
that recognizes this language and then (2) applying the construction
from the book to convert the DFA to an equivalent CFG. A complete
submission will include the state diagram of the DFA, a brief
justification of why it recognizes the language, and then the complete
and precise definition of the CFG that results from applying the
construction from the book to this DFA. <span><em>Ungraded bonus: take a
sample string in the language and see how the computation of the DFA on
this string translates to a derivation in your
grammar.</em></span></p></li>

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span> You will practice
analyzing, designing, and working with Turing machines. You will use
general constructions and specific machines to explore the classes of
recognizable and decidable languages. You will explore various ways to
encode machines as strings so that computational problems can be
recognized.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 5-7. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Sections 3.1, 3.3, 4.1 Chapter 3 exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8.
Chapter 4 exercises 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw4CSE105W24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Classifying languages</strong> (10 points): Our first
example of a more complicated Turing machine was of a Turing machine
that recognized the language <span class="math inline">\(\{w \# w \mid w
\in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span>, which we know is not context-free. The language
<span class="math display">\[\{0^n 1^n 2^n \mid n \geq 0\}\]</span> is
also not context-free.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
Give an implementation-level description of a Turing machine that
recognizes this language.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
Draw a state diagram of the Turing machine you gave in part (a) and
trace the computation of this Turing machine on the input <span
class="math inline">\(012\)</span>. You may use all our usual
conventions for state diagrams of Turing machines (we do not include the
node for the reject state <span class="math inline">\(qrej\)</span> and
any missing transitions in the state diagram have value <span
class="math inline">\((qrej,\square,R)\)</span>; <span
class="math inline">\(b \to R\)</span> label means <span
class="math inline">\(b \to b, R\)</span> ).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Deciders, Recognizers, Decidability, and
Recognizability</strong> (15 points): For this question, consider the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Give an example of
a finite, nonempty language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and two different Turing machines
that recognize it: one that is a decider and one that is not. A complete
solution will include a precise definition for your example language,
along with <span><strong>both</strong></span> a state diagram and an
implementation-level description of each Turing machines, along with a
brief explanation of why each of them recognizes the language and why
one is a decider and there other is not.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) True or false:
There is a Turing machine that is not a decider that recognizes the
empty set. A complete solution will include a witness Turing machine
(given by state diagram or implementation-level description or
high-level description) and a justification for why it’s not a decider
and why it does not accept any strings, or a complete and correct
justification for why there is no such Turing machine.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) True or false:
There is a Turing machine that is not a decider that recognizes the set
of all string <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>. A complete
solution will include a witness Turing machine (given by state diagram
or implementation-level description or high-level description) and a
justification for why it’s not a decider and why it accept each string
over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, or a complete and
correct justification for why there is no such Turing machine.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Closure</strong> (15 points): Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a Turing machine over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \ldots\)</span> be a list of all strings
in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in string (shortlex)
order. We define a new Turing machine by giving its high-level
description as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   M_{new} &amp;= ``\text{On input }w:\\
    &amp;\text{1. For $n = 1, 2, \ldots$}\\
    &amp;\text{2.~~~For $j = 1, 2, \ldots n$} \\
    &amp;\text{3.~~~For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$} \\
    &amp;\text{4.~~~~~~Run the computation of $M$ on $s_jws_k$}\\
    &amp;\text{5.~~~~~~If it accepts, accept.}\\
    &amp;\text{6.~~~~~~If it rejects, go to the next iteration of the
loop&quot;}\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have: For languages <span
class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we have the associated
sets of strings <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L_1) = \{ w \in
\Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } a,b \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } awb
\in L_1\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w
\in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and }
v \in L_2 \}\]</span> We say that self-set-wise concatenation of the set
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(L_1 \circ L_1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Note: there was a bug in the version of this assignment
that was first released.</em></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Prove that this
Turing machine construction <span><strong>cannot</strong></span> be used
to prove that the class of decidable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under
<span><strong>either</strong></span> of the above operations (<span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span> or self-set-wise
concatenation). A complete answer will give a counterexample or general
description why the construction doesn’t work for both
operations.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that this
Turing machine construction cannot be used to prove that the class of
recognizable languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>
is closed under the <span class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span> set
operation. In particular, give a counterexample of a specific language
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and Turing machine <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> recognizing it where <span
class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> does not recognize <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(L_1)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Define a new
construction by slightly modifiying this one that can be used to prove
that the class of recognizable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span>. Justify that your construction
works. The proof of correctness for the closure claim can be structured
like: “Let <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> be a recognizable
language over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and assume we
are given a Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> so
that <span class="math inline">\(L(M_1) = L_1\)</span>. Consider the new
Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> defined
above. We will show that <span class="math inline">\(L(M_{new}) =
SUBSTRING(L_1)\)</span>... <span><em>complete the proof by proving
subset inclusion in two directions, by tracing the relevant Turing
machine computations</em></span>”</p></li>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Pick five of the
computational problems above and give examples (preferably different
from the ones we talked about in class) of strings that are in each of
the corresponding languages. Remember to use the notation <span
class="math inline">\(\langle \cdots \rangle\)</span> to denote the
string encoding of relevant objects. <span><em>Extension, not for
credit:</em></span> Explain why it’s hard to write a specific string of
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s and make a claim about membership in
one of these sets.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Computational
problems can also be defined about Turing machines. Consider the two
high-level descriptions of Turing machines below. Reverse-engineer them
to define the computational problem that is being recognized, where
<span class="math inline">\(L(M_{DFA})\)</span> is the language
corresponding to this computational problem about DFA and <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_{TM})\)</span> is the language corresponding
to this computational problem about Turing machines.
<span><em>Hint</em></span>: the computational problem is not acceptance,
language emptiness, or language equality (but is related to one of
them).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \ldots\)</span> be a list
of all strings in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in
string (shortlex) order. Consider the following Turing machines <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        M_{DFA} &amp;= ``\text{On input $\langle D \rangle$ where $D$ is
a DFA}:\\
         &amp;\text{1. for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$} \\
         &amp;\text{2.~~~ Run $D$ on $s_i$} \\
         &amp;\text{3.~~~~If it accepts, accept.}\\
         &amp;\text{4.~~~~If it rejects, go to the next iteration of the
loop&quot;}\\
     
\end{aligned}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        M_{TM} &amp;= ``\text{On input $\langle T \rangle$ where $T$ is

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span> You will practice
analyzing, designing, and working with Turing machines. You will use
general constructions and specific machines to explore the classes of
recognizable and decidable languages. You will explore various ways to
encode machines as strings so that computational problems can be
recognized.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 7-10. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>

<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw5CSE105W24”.</p>

<p>The CSE 105 project is designed for you to go deeper and extend your
work on assignments and to explore an application of your choosing. The
project is an individual assignment and has two tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Implementing the construction that converts NFA to DFA,
and</p>
<p>Task 2: Illustrating the theorem that every regular language is
decidable</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE
105 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback). Tools
for drawing state diagrams (like Flap.js and JFLAP) can be used to help
draw the diagrams in the project too. These resources should be more
than enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look
elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any
resources you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them),
including any large-language model style resources. Link directly to
them and include the name of the author / video creator, any search
strings or prompts you used, and the reason you consulted this
reference.</p>
<p>The work you submit for the project needs to be your own. Again, you
shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than this quarter’s material and
doing so may result in definitions or notations that conflict with our
norms in this class so think carefully before you go down this path.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any part of the project, we encourage you to
focus on communicating what you think the question might mean, including
bringing an example from class or homework you think might be relevant,
and include any submission any aspect where you’re unsure. Clear
communication about these theoretical ideas and their applications ia
one of the main goals of the project.</p>
<p><span><strong>Submitting the project</strong></span> You will submit
a PDF plus a video file for the first task and a PDF for the second
task. All file submissions will be in Gradescope.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-1-implementing-a-construction">Task 1:
Implementing a construction</h3>
<p>Nondeterminism is a useful theoretical concept because it can make
designs simpler and more modular. However, our actual devices are
deterministic. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a language
that can be represented using nondeterminism in some interesting way,
then illustrate the construction that converts NFA to DFA for this
example.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose an alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>
for this entire first task of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that takes as input a
representation of an NFA over this alphabet and outputs a representation
of a DFA over this alphabet that recognizes the same language. You get
to choose the way NFA and DFA are represented, so long as it is general
enough to represent any NFA and any DFA over this alphabet. For
simplicity: you can restrict your attention to NFA **without spontaneous
moves** (in other words, where the transition function has domain <span
class="math inline">\(Q \times \Sigma\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is the set of states of the NFA).
Informally, this means that the nondeterminism is coming from there
being zero, one, or more arrows coming out of each state for each
character in the alphabet and there are no arrows with <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> labels.</p>
<p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT to
help you write this program. However, you should test the code that is
produced and be able to explain what it is doing. As a header in your
code file, include a comment block describing any resources that were
used to help generate your code.</p>
<p>Whenever your program is run, it should display a representation of
the input NFA and of the output DFA of the run.</p></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, design a NFA over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> with three states and with no
spontaneous moves where the language of the NFA is neither <span
class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span> and draw its state diagram. Your
NFA should use nondeterminism in some way. In other words, the state
diagram you draw can’t already be the state diagram of a DFA. Run your
program with the NFA you just designed to output a representation of an
equivalent DFA and demonstrate its design and the test case on
video.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span></p>
<p>For this task, you will submit a PDF plus a video file.</p>
<p>The PDF should include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clear specification of alphabet and state diagram of chosen
three-state NFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation for program converting NFA to DFA: include a
description of how NFA and DFA are represented in the program and give
instructions for running it.</p></li>
<li><p>Printout of code for program converting NFA to DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Screen shots of demonstration of running your program on your
chosen NFA, including the representation of the output DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Solution is typed or clearly hand drawn with precise language and
notation for all terms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. To
demonstrate your work, you will create a 3-5 minute screencast video
with the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the
beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t
have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you
are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the
video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the NFA you will be working with. Your video should
include a clear and precise explanation of why the language of this NFA
is not empty and also not the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the code for your program,
including the software design choices you made (e.g. which data
structures are you using, etc.) and any resources you used. The video
should clearly describe which programming language was chosen for the
implementation and gives the reasons why.</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the representation of the NFA that
you will input to the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate running your code on your example input. The video
should include screencasts of running the code live. Explain why the
output of your program is what you would expect, by connecting the
output of the program to a DFA and discussing which strings are accepted
/ rejected by this DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Logistics: video needs to load correctly, be between 3 and 5
minutes, show your face and ID, and you introduce yourself audibly while
on screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Clarity and brevity are both
important aspects of your video. In previous years, we’ve seen students
speed up their videos to get below the 5 minute upper bound. This is ok
so long as it doesn’t compromise clarity.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-2-illustrating-a-theorem">Task 2:
Illustrating a theorem</h3>
<p>In this part of the project, you’ll choose a pattern in an
application you care about, define it precisely, build a DFA that
recognizes it, and then build the related Turing machine that proves
that the language encoding this pattern is decidable.</p>
<p>First, pick <span><strong>one</strong></span> application for your
example. Here are some ideas to get you started - but you can choose to
go in a different direction.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data validation for input in text files (e.g. emails with
specific domains, dates in specific formats, PIDs in a class list,
etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Finding ASCII codes for punctuation in a binary file.</p></li>
<li><p>The CDC recommended procedure for hand washing (Refer to the
guidelines from the CDC here <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/index.html</a>
in your explanation. You might find the first example in chapter 1 about
automatic door controllers helpful when starting your design.)</p></li>
<li><p>See more ideas here: <a
href="https://theory-cs.github.io/files/practical-applications-of-theory-of-computation.pdf">https://theory-cs.github.io/files/practical-applications-of-theory-of-computation.pdf</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In a paragraph or so, give the context for your chosen
application and why you chose it.</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the alphabet for your example and write a precise
(mathematical and/or English) description of a set of strings over this
alphabet that is relevant to this application, and include a sentence or
so justifying why this set is important and relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Give one example of a string over this alphabet in this set and a
string over this (same) alphabet not in this set, and explain why you
chose these example strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Design a DFA that recognizes this language. Clearly draw and
label the state diagram of this DFA and briefly justify why your design
works by describing the role of each state of the DFA and relating it to
a plain English description of the language you picked.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the construction in the proof that all regular languages are
decidable (informally described in Theorem 4.1 in the book) to build a
Turing machine that simulates your DFA. Hint: your Turing machine will
have exactly two more states than your DFA. Draw the state diagram of
your Turing machine.</p></li>
<li><p>For one of the strings from step 4., draw a representation of the
computation of your Turing machine on this string. Remember that to
describe the computation of a Turing machine, we need to include the
contents of the tape, the state of the machine, and the location of the
read/write head at each step in the computation. In class we’ve drawn
pictures to represent the configuration of the machine at each step in a
computation. You may do so or you may choose to describe these
configurations in words.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Solution typed or clearly hand-written/drawn with precise
language and notation for all terms and complete, correct, and clear
justification.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the six steps is complete and included in the PDF, with
precise language and notation for all terms and complete, correct, and
clear justification.</p></li>
</ul>
