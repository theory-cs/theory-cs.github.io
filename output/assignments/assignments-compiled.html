<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying the definitions of alphabets,
strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions. You will use
regular expressions and relate them to languages and finite automata.
You will use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of
finite automata, and you will use clear English to describe computations
of finite automata informally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 0 and 1. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1. Chapter 1 exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.18,
1.23.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1CSE105F24”.</p>

referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
language <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> over <span

expression <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span> is the language recognized by this
finite automaton. Justify your answer by referring to the definition of
the semantics of regular expressions and computations of finite

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Keeping the same
set of states <span class="math inline">\(Q = \{q_0, q_1,

states <span class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span> so that the new
finite automaton that results accepts at least one string that the
original one rejected <span><strong>and</strong></span> rejects at least
one string that the original one accepted, or explain why there is no
such choice of <span class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span>. A complete
solution will include either (1) a precise and clear description of your
choice of <span class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span> and a precise and
clear the two example strings using relevant definitions to justify
them, or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no
such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Automata design</strong> (12 points): As background to
this question, recall that integers can be represented using base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansions, for any convenient choice
of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The precise definition
is: for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> an integer greater than
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
Design a DFA that recognizes the set of binary (base <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) expansions of positive integers that
are powers of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. A complete
solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and a brief
justification of your construction by explaining the role each state
plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the
strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified
language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) A power of <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is an integer <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that can be written as <span
class="math inline">\(2^y\)</span> for some nonnegative integer <span

<span class="math inline">\(100\)</span>, <span

your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the
machine, as well as a brief justification about how the strings accepted
and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.</p>
<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) Consider having a state for each
possible remainder upon division by <span

that reading a new character will shift what we already read over by one
slot.</p></li>

you need all <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> states? Could you

<li><p><strong>General constructions</strong> (15 points): In this
question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for
NFAs and translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Consider the
following general construction: Let <span class="math inline">\(N_1 =
(Q, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> be a NFA and assume that <span
class="math inline">\(q_0 \notin Q\)</span>. Define the new NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N_2 = (Q \cup \{q_0\}, \Sigma, \delta_2, q_0,
\{q_1\})\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[\delta_2: (Q \cup
\{q_0\}) \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P} (Q \cup
\{q_0\})\]</span> is defined by <span class="math display">\[\delta_2
(q,a) = \begin{cases}
        \{ q&#39; \in Q \mid q \in \delta_1(q&#39;,a)\} &amp;\text{if $q
\in Q$, $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$} \\
        F_1 &amp;\text{if $q =q_0$, $a = \varepsilon$}\\
        \emptyset &amp;\text{if $q = q_0$, $a \in \Sigma$}
    \end{cases}\]</span> Illustrate this construction by defining a
specific example NFA <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and
applying the construction above to create the new NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span>. Your example NFA should</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have exactly four states (all reachable from the start
state),</p></li>
<li><p>Accept at least one string and reject at least one string,
and</p></li>
<li><p>Not have any states labelled <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the construction above to create the new NFA. A complete
submission will include the state diagram of your example NFA <span
class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and the state diagram of the NFA
<span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> resulting from this
construction and a precise and clear description of <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_2)\)</span>, justified by explaining the role
each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about
how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the
language.</p></li>
<li><p>In Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have: For each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we have the
associated set of strings <span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w
\in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and }
v \in \Sigma_1^* \}\]</span> We will prove that the collection of
languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> that are
each recognizable by some NFA is closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span> operation.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) As a helpful tool
in our construction<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, prove that every NFA can be
converted to an equivalent one that has a single accept state. Note:
this is exercise 1.11 in the textbook.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that the
collection of languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> that are each recognizable by
some NFA is closed under the <span class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span>
operation. You can assume that you are given a NFA with a single accept
state <span class="math inline">\(N = (Q, \{0,1\}, \delta, q_0,
\{q_{acc}\})\)</span> and you need to define a new NFA, <span
class="math inline">\(N_{new} = (Q_{new}, \{0,1\}, \delta_{new},
q_{new}, F_{new})\)</span>, so that <span
class="math inline">\(L(N_{new}) = EXTEND(L(N))\)</span>.</p>
<p>A complete solution will include precise definitions for <span
class="math inline">\(Q_{new}, \delta_{new}, q_{new},\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F_{new}\)</span>, as well as a a brief
justification of your construction by explaining why these definitions
work, referring specifically to the definition of <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span> and to acceptance of NFA.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple representations</strong> (8 points): For any
language <span class="math inline">\(L \subseteq \Sigma^*\)</span>,
recall that we define its <em>complement</em> as <span
class="math display">\[\overline{L} := \Sigma^* - L = \{w \in \Sigma^*
\mid w \notin L\}\]</span> That is, the complement of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> contains all and only those strings
which are not in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Our notation
for regular expressions does not include the complement symbol. However,
it turns out that the complement of a language described by a regular
expression is guaranteed to also be describable by a (different) regular
expression.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma =
\{a,b\}\)</span>, the complement of the language described by the
regular expression <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^* b\)</span> is
described by the regular expression <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon \cup \Sigma^*a\)</span> because any
string that does not end in <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must
either be the empty string or end in <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>For each of the regular expressions <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{a,b\}\)</span> below, write the regular
expression for <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>.
Your regular expressions may use the symbols <span
class="math inline">\(\varnothing\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the following operations to
combine them: union, concatenation, and Kleene star.</p>
<p>Briefly justify why your solution for each part works by giving plain
English descriptions of the language described by the regular expression
and of its complement and connecting them to the regular expression via
relevant definitions. An English description that is more detailed than
simply negating the description in the original language will likely be
helpful in the justification.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can justify your solution by first designing a DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(L(R)\)</span>, using the
construction from class and the book to modify this DFA to get a new DFA
that recognizes <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(R)}\)</span>,
and then applying the constructions from class and the book to convert
this new DFA to a regular expression.</p>
<p>For each part of the question, clearly state which approach you’re
taking and include enough intermediate steps to illustrate your
work.</p>

<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>

<li><p>Consider the language <span class="math inline">\(A_1 = \{ uw
\mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}\)</span>
and the following argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^p 0^p\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> and has length greater than or equal
to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> ought to be pump’able. That is, there
should be a way of dividing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into
parts <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in A_1\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> are such that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>.
Since the first <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> letters of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|xy|
\leq p\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are made up of all <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s. If we let <span
class="math inline">\(i=2\)</span>, we get a string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> because repeating <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> twice adds <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> but not to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and strings in <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> are required to have <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> be the same length. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we have demonstrated
that <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> has no pumping length. By
the Pumping Lemma, this implies that <span
class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> is nonregular.</p>

   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}\)</span>
and the following argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Proof" that <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> is not regular
using the Pumping Lemma: Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be
an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choose <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to be the string <span
class="math inline">\(1^{p+1} 0^{p}\)</span>, which is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> because we can choose <span
class="math inline">\(u = 1^p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w
= 0^p\)</span> which each have length <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is in <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> and has length greater than or equal
to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping length for <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> ought to be pump’able. That is, there
should be a way of dividing <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> into
parts <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(s=xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt;0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>, and
for each <span class="math inline">\(i \geq 0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz \in A_2\)</span>. When <span
class="math inline">\(x = \varepsilon\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y = 1^{p+1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z = 0^{p}\)</span>, we have satisfied that <span
class="math inline">\(s = xyz\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|y|
&gt; 0\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is
positive) and <span class="math inline">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span>. If we
let <span class="math inline">\(i=0\)</span>, we get the string <span
class="math inline">\(xy^iz = 0^{p}\)</span> that is not in <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> because its middle symbol is a <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, not a <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Thus, <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not pumpable (even though it should
have been if <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> were to be a pumping
length) and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is not a pumping
length for <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> was arbitrary, we have demonstrated
that <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> has no pumping length. By
the Pumping Lemma, this implies that <span
class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> is nonregular.</p>

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will work with context-free languages and their representations.
You will also practice analyzing, designing, and working with Turing
machines. You will use general constructions and specific machines to
explore the classes of recognizable and decidable languages.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 4, 5, and 6. We will
post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned
Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 2 exercises 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5,
2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.16, 2.17. Chapter 3 exercises
3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw4CSE105F24”.</p>

<li><p><strong>General constructions for context-free languages</strong>
(21 points):</p>
<p>In class in weeks 4 and 5, we described several general constructions
with PDAs and CFGs, leaving their details to homework. In this question,
we’ll fill in these details. The first constructions help us prove that
the class of regular languages is a subset of the class of context-free
languages. The other construction allows us to make simplifying
assumptions about PDAs recognizing languages.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
When we first introduced PDAs we observed that any NFA can be
transformed to a PDA by not using the stack of the PDA at all. Suppose a
friend gives you the following construction to formalize this
transformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a NFA <span class="math inline">\(N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta_N,
q_0, F)\)</span> we define a PDA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(L(M) = L(N)\)</span> by letting <span
class="math inline">\(M = ( Q, \Sigma, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\delta(~(q,a,b)~) =
\delta_N(~(q,a)~)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(q \in
Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a \in
\Sigma_{\varepsilon}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \in
\Sigma_{\varepsilon}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each of the six defining parameters for the PDA, explain whether
it’s defined correctly or not. If it is not defined correctly, explain
why not and give a new definition for this parameter that corrects the
mistake.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In the book on
page 107, the top paragraph describes a procedure for converting DFAs to
CFGs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can convert any DFA into an equivalent CFG as follows. Make a
variable <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> for each state <span
class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> of the DFA. Add the rule <span
class="math inline">\(R_i \to aR_j\)</span> to the CFG if <span
class="math inline">\(\delta(q_i,a) =q_j\)</span> is a transition in the
DFA. Add the rule <span class="math inline">\(R_i\to
\varepsilon\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is an
accept state of the DFA. Make <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>
the start variable ofthe grammar, where <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> is the start state of the machine.
Verify on your own that the resulting CFG generates the same language
that the DFA recognizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use this construction to get a context-free grammar generating the
language <span class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* \mid w \text{
does not end in  $101$}\}\]</span> by (1) designing a DFA that
recognizes this language and then (2) applying the construction from the
book to convert the DFA to an equivalent CFG. A complete and correct
submission will include the state diagram of the DFA, a brief
justification of why it recognizes the language, and then the complete
and precise definition of the CFG that results from applying the
construction from the book to this DFA. <span><em>Ungraded bonus: take a
sample string in the language and see how the computation of the DFA on
this string translates to a derivation in your
grammar.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1,
\delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> be a PDA and let <span

state labels (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 \cap \{q_{new},
r_{new}, s_{new}\} = \emptyset\)</span>) and let <span
class="math inline">\(\#\)</span> be a fresh stack symbol (i.e. <span

<p>Remember that the definition of set-wise concatenation is: for

why there is no such example. A complete solution will include either
(1) a precise and clear description of your example string and a precise
and clear description of the looping (non-halting) computation of the
Turing machine on this string or (2) a sufficiently general and correct
argument why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) True or false:
There is a Turing machine that is not a decider that recognizes the

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice analyzing, designing, and working with Turing
machines. You will use general constructions and specific machines to
explore the classes of recognizable and decidable languages. You will
explore various ways to encode machines as strings so that computational
problems can be recognized.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 6 and 7. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza

(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the

<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw5CSE105F24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Classifying languages</strong> (10 points): Our first
example of a more complicated Turing machine was of a Turing machine
that recognized the language <span class="math inline">\(\{w \# w \mid w
\in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span>, which we know is not context-free. Let’s call
that Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span>. The
language <span class="math display">\[L = \{ww \mid w \in
\{0,1\}^*\}\]</span> is also not context-free.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
Choose an example string of length <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> that is in
<span><strong>not</strong></span> in <span class="math inline">\(\{w \#
w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span> and describe the computation of the
Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> on your example
string. Include the contents of the tape, the state of the machine, and
the location of the read/write head at each step in the
computation.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
Explain why the Turing machine from the textbook and class that
recognized <span class="math inline">\(\{w \# w \mid w
\in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span> does not recognize <span
class="math inline">\(\{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}\)</span>. Use your
example to explain why <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> doesn’t
recognize <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Explain how you
would change <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> to get a new
Turing machine that does recognize <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Describe this new Turing machine using
both an implementation-level definition and a state diagram of the
Turing machine. You may use all our usual conventions for state diagrams
of Turing machines (we do not include the node for the reject state
<span class="math inline">\(qrej\)</span> and any missing transitions in
the state diagram have value <span
class="math inline">\((qrej,\square,R)\)</span>; <span
class="math inline">\(b \to R\)</span> label means <span
class="math inline">\(b \to b, R\)</span> ).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Closure</strong> (18 points): Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a Turing machine over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \ldots\)</span> be a list of all strings
in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in string (shortlex)
order. We define a new Turing machine by giving its high-level
description as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   M_{new} &amp;= ``\text{On input }w:\\
    &amp;\text{1. For $n = 1, 2, \ldots$}\\
    &amp;\text{2.~~~For $j = 1, 2, \ldots n$} \\
    &amp;\text{3.~~~For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$} \\
    &amp;\text{4.~~~~~~Run the computation of $M$ on $s_jws_k$}\\
    &amp;\text{5.~~~~~~If it accepts, accept.}\\
    &amp;\text{6.~~~~~~If it rejects, go to the next iteration of the
loop&quot;}\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have: For each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we have the
associated sets of strings <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) =
\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma_1^* \text{
such that } xwy \in L\}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{
for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma_1^* \}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that this
Turing machine construction <span><strong>cannot</strong></span> be used
to prove that the class of decidable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under the <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span> operation. A complete and correct
answer will give a counterexample which is a set <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> that is decidable, along with a
definition of Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_A\)</span>
that decides <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (with a
justification why this Turing machine accepts all strings in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and rejects all strings not in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>), and then either a description of the
language of <span class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> that results
when setting the Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M =
M_A\)</span> and an explanation why <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_{new}) \neq EXTEND(A)\)</span> or a
description why <span class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> is not a
decider and therefore can’t witness that <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND(A)\)</span> is decidable.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that this
Turing machine construction cannot be used to prove that the class of
recognizable languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>
is closed under the <span class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span> set
operation. A complete and correct answer will give a counterexample of a
specific language <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and Turing
machine <span class="math inline">\(M_B\)</span> recognizing it (with a
justification why this Turing machine accepts all and only strings in
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), and then a description of the
language of <span class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> that results
when setting the Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M =
M_B\)</span> and an explanation why <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_{new}) \neq SUBSTRING(B)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Define a new
construction by slightly modifiying this one that can be used to prove
that the class of recognizable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span>. Justify that your construction
works. The proof of correctness for the closure claim can be structured
like: “Let <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> be a recognizable
language over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and assume we
are given a Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> so
that <span class="math inline">\(L(M_1) = L_1\)</span>. Consider the new
Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> defined
above. We will show that <span class="math inline">\(L(M_{new}) =
SUBSTRING(L_1)\)</span>... <span><em>complete the proof by proving
subset inclusion in two directions, by tracing the relevant Turing
machine computations</em></span>”</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Prove that the
class of recognizable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND\)</span>.</p></li>

include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw6CSE105F24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>What’s wrong with these reductions? (if
anything)</strong> (15 points): Suppose your friends are practicing
coming up with mapping reductions <span class="math inline">\(A \leq_m
B\)</span> and their witnessing functions <span class="math inline">\(f:
\Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*\)</span>. For each of the following attempts,
determine if it has error(s) or is correct. Do so by labelling each
attempt with all and only the labels below that apply, and justifying
this labelling.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Error Type 1:</em> The given function can’t witness the
claimed mapping reduction because there exists an <span
class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \not\in B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Error Type 2:</em> The given function can’t witness the
claimed mapping reduction because there exists an <span
class="math inline">\(x \not\in A\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \in B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Error Type 3:</em> The given function can’t witness the
claimed mapping reduction because the specified function is not
computable.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Correct:</em> The claimed mapping reduction is true and is
witnessed by the given function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly present your answer by providing a brief (3-4 sentences or
so) justification for whether <span><strong>each</strong></span> of
these labels applies to each example.</p>

<p>The CSE 105 project is designed for you to go deeper and extend your
work on assignments and to see how some of the abstract notions we
discuss can be implemented in concrete ways. The project is an
individual assignment and has two tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Illustrating the decidability of a computational problem,
and</p>
<p>Task 2: Illustrating a mapping reduction</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE
105 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback). Tools
for drawing state diagrams (like Flap.js and JFLAP and the PrairieLearn
automata library) can be used to help draw the diagrams in the project
too.</p>
<p>These resources should be more than enough. If you are struggling to
get started and want to look elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this
by listing and citing any resources you consult (even if you do not
explicitly quote them), including any large-language model style
resources (ChatGPT, Bard, Co-Pilot, etc.). Link directly to them and
include the name of the author / video creator, any and all search
strings or prompts you used, and the reason you consulted this
reference. The work you submit for the project needs to be your own.
Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than this quarter’s
material and doing so may result in definitions that conflict with our
conventions in this class so think carefully before you go down this
path.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any part of the project, we encourage you to
focus on communicating what you think the question might mean, including
bringing an example from class or homework you think might be relevant,
and include any submission any aspect where you’re unsure. Clear
communication about these theoretical ideas and their applications is
one of the main goals of the project.</p>
<p><span><strong>Submitting the project</strong></span> You will submit
a PDF plus a video file for the first task and a PDF plus a video fiile
for the second task. All file submissions will be in Gradescope.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-video">Your video:</h3>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU"
class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU</a>.</p>

<p>Please send an email to the instructors (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>

1: Illustrating the decidability of a computational problem</h3>
<p>Many computational problems are decidable, sometimes using beautiful
algorithms. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a
<span><strong>decidable</strong></span> computational problem, and
demonstrate the proof that it is decidable by building a program in a
programming language of your choice (aka a high-level description of a
Turing machine) that decides it. You will then demonstrate how your
construction works for some test examples.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a decidable computational problem from Section 4.1.
<span><em>Note: if you’d like to consider a different computational
problem instead, please check with Prof. Minnes first. You must do so no
later than the start of Week 9.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that decides this computational
problem. The function input must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span> and part of your work in this
program is to design string representations for arbitrary instances of
the model of computation the computational problem you picked is about
(e.g. DFA, NFA, regular expressions, CFG, or NFA). The function output
must be a <span><strong>boolean</strong></span> true (if the string is
in the set representing the computational problem) or false (if the
string is not in the set representing the computational problem).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may use our class notes and the textbook for ideas on the
algorithm that your program will implement.</p></li>
<li><p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT
to help you write this program. However, you should test the code that
is produced and be able to explain what it is doing. Your code needs to
be well-organized and well-documented. As a header in your code file,
include a comment block describing any resources that were used to help
generate your code, including any and all prompts used in interactions
with LLM coding tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, select one string that is in the set
representing the computational problem, and one string that is not in
the set representing the computational problem, explain why these
strings are valid examples, and demonstrate running your program on each
to get the appropriate output.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. To
demonstrate your work, you will create a 3-5 minute screencast video
explaining your code design and demonstrating its functionality.</p>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span> For this task,
you will submit a PDF plus a video file.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writeup includes a clear specification of computational problem
being decided.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation for program deciding this computational problem:
include a description of how input strings are parsed to represent
instances of the computational problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear specification of two example strings, explaining which is
in the set (and why) and which is not in the set (and why not).</p></li>
<li><p>Project submission includes a printout of code for program
implementing algorithm to decide the computational problem, as well as
screen shots demonstrating running your program on your example
strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Project writeup is typed or clearly hand drawn with precise
language and notation for all terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID visible for a few
seconds at the beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on
screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though
it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s
you creating the video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the computational problem you will be working with, and
example strings that you will be using, including explanations of why
you chose this problem and these strings (and why one of the strings is
in the set and why the other is not).</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the code for your program,
including the software design choices you made (e.g. which data
structures are you using, etc.) and any resources you used. The video
should clearly describe which programming language was chosen for the
implementation and gives the reasons why.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate running your code on each of your example inputs. The
video should include screencasts of running the code live. Explain why
the output of your program is what you would expect, by connecting the
output of the the definition of the computational problem and your
chosen parsing of input strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Logistics: video needs to load correctly, be between 3 and 5
minutes, show your face and ID, and you introduce yourself audibly while
on screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Clarity and brevity are both
important aspects of your video. In previous years, we’ve seen students
speed up their videos to get below the 5 minute upper bound. This is ok
so long as it doesn’t compromise clarity. If the graders need to slow
your video down to understand it, it may not earn full credit.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-2-illustrating-a-mapping-reduction">Task
2: Illustrating a mapping reduction</h3>
<p>We can use mapping reductions to prove that interesting computational
problems are undecidable, building on the undecidability of other
computational problems. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a
specific <span><strong>mapping reduction</strong></span> and implement a
computable function that witnesses it using a programming language of
your choice (aka a high-level description of a Turing machine that
computes it). You will then demonstrate how your construction works for
some test examples.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a mapping reduction we discussed in class or in the
homework or in review quizzes or in the textbook where both sets being
compared are undecidable. <span><em>Note: if you’d like to consider a
mapping reduction we have not discussed instead, please check with Prof.
Minnes first. You must do so no later than the start of Week
9.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that implements a computable
function witnessing this mapping reduction. The function input must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span> and the function output must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span>. Part of your work in this program
is to design string representations for arbitrary instances of the model
of computation the computational problems being compared in the mapping
reduction. Your function will need to be able to process *any* string as
input.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may use our class notes and the textbook for ideas on the
algorithm that your program will implement.</p></li>
<li><p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT
to help you write this program. However, you should test the code that
is produced and be able to explain what it is doing. Your code needs to
be well-organized and well-documented. As a header in your code file,
include a comment block describing any resources that were used to help
generate your code, including any and all prompts used in interactions
with LLM coding tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, you will need to run it for an
example positive and negative instance. That is to say, if you are
implementing a computable function witnessing <span
class="math inline">\(X \leq_m Y\)</span>, you will select one string
that is in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and one string that is
not in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and you will demonstrate
running your program on each of these strings and explain why the output
of the function is good.</p></li>
