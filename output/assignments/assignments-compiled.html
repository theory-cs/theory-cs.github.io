</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying definitions to get comfortable working with mathematical language. As a result, you can expect to spend more time reading the questions and looking up notation than doing calculations.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span></p>
<p>Weekly homework may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. The lowest HW score will not be included in your overall HW average. Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your homework submission.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be hand-drawn and scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for typesetting your solutions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework with anyone other than your group members. You may ask questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions we will use this quarter.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the assignment called “hw1-definitions-and-notation”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 0 and 1. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>) Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation or as a result of set operations applied to other known sets. Rewrite them using the roster method.</p>
<p>Remember our discussions of data-types: use clear notation that is consistent with our class notes and definitions to communicate the data-types of the elements in each set.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \texttt{A}\} \circ \{ \texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{C}, \texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\)</span> can be written using the roster method as <span class="math display">\[\{ \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{U}, \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{C}, \texttt{A}\texttt{A}\texttt{G}\}\]</span> because set-wise concatenation gives a set whose elements are all possible results of concatenating an element of the left set with an element of the right set. Since the left set in this example only has one element (<span class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>), each of the elements of the set we described starts with <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{A}\)</span>. There are three elements of this set, one for each of the distinct elements of the right set.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 1 \} \circ \{x \in S \mid rnalen(x) = 1 \}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the set of RNA strands and <span class="math inline">\(rnalen\)</span> is the recursively defined function that we discussed in class.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ (r,g,b) \in C \mid r+g+b = 1\}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C = \{ (r,g,b) \mid 0 \leq r \leq 255, 0 \leq g \leq 255, 0 \leq b \leq 255, r \in \mathbb{N}, g \in \mathbb{N}, b \in \mathbb{N} \}\)</span> is the set that you worked with in Monday’s review quiz.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math display">\[\{ a \in \mathbb{Z} \mid  a \textbf{ div } 2 = a \textbf{ mod } 2\}\]</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>)</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In Wednesday’s review quiz, you considered some attempted recursive definitions for the function with domain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and with codomain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> which gives <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Write out a correct recursive definition of this function.</p></li>
<li><p>How would your answer to part (a) change if we consider a new function with the same domain and rule but whose codomain is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>How would your answer to part (a) change if we consider a new function with the same codomain and rule but whose domain is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>Write a recursive definition of the function with domain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span>, codomain <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> and which gives <span class="math inline">\(n!\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(!\)</span> symbol is the “factorial” symbol and means that we need to multiple <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> by each of the integers between it and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> inclusive. For example, <span class="math inline">\(5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall the function <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> which takes an ordered pair of ratings <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples and returns a measure of the distance between them given by <span class="math display">\[d_0 (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3), (y_1, y_2, y_3) ~) ~) = \sqrt{ (x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + (x_3 -y_3)^2}\]</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the detail expected in your answers for this question:</em> </span></p>
<p>To give an example of two <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples that are <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> distance <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each other, consider the <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples <span class="math inline">\((1,0,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((0,0,0)\)</span>. We calculate the function application: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    d_0 (~(~ (1, 0,0), (0,0,0) ~) ~) &amp;= \sqrt{ (1 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 + (0 -0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{1} = 1,\end{aligned}\]</span> which is the result required for this example.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Give an example of three <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp;(x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}) \\
    &amp;(x_{2,1}, x_{2,2}, x_{2,3}) \\
    &amp;(x_{3,1}, x_{3,2}, x_{3,3}) \\
    \end{aligned}\]</span> that are all <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> distance <span><strong>greater than</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each other. In other words, for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(i \neq j\)</span>), <span class="math display">\[d_{0}(~(~(x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, x_{i,3})  , (x_{j,1}, x_{j,2}, x_{j,3})~)~) &gt; 1\]</span></p>
<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span> specific values for each example <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span><strong>and</strong></span> a justification of your examples with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references to definitions and connecting them with the desired conclusion.<br />
<span><em>To think about</em></span>: how will you justify that the square root of a number is greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>? Are calculations from a calculator accurate enough to help us?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the range of values that results from applying the function <span class="math inline">\(d_0\)</span> to ordered pairs of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple ratings? That is, what are the smallest and largest possible results?</p>
<p>Your answer should include <span><strong>both</strong></span> specific values for the smallest and largest possible results <span><strong>and</strong></span> a justification of your answers with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references to definitions and connecting them with the desired conclusion.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will consider multiple number representations and how they connect to applications in computer science. You will also practice tracing and working with algorithms.</p>
<p>Instructions and academic integrity reminders for all homework assignments in CSE20 this quarter are on the class website and on the hw1-definitions-and-notations assignment.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the assignment called “hw2-numbers”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are working with for this assignment, see the class material from Friday of Week 1 and Monday and Wednesday of Week 2. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>) Pick a nonnegative integer between 100 and 1000 (inclusive) and express it using at least three different representations, at least two of which must be ones discussed in class. Include at least one trace of using procedure <span class="math inline">\(baseb1\)</span> from page 16 of the Week 0 and 1 notes to calculate the base <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> expansion of your number (for your choice of <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>) and include at least one trace of using procedure <span class="math inline">\(baseb2\)</span> from page 16 of the Week 0 and 1 notes to calculate the base <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span> expansion of your number (for your choice of <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span>).</p>
<p><span><em>Extra; not for credit:</em></span> Consider choosing representations that might be useful in some way; what would make one representation more useful than another?</p></li>
<li><p>In this question, we will use recursive definitions to give a precise description of the set of strings that form octal (base <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>) expansions and the values of those expansions. Let’s start by defining the set of possible coefficients <span class="math display">\[C_8 = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Fill in the recursive definition of the set of all strings that form octal expansions, <span class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span>:</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span> The set <span class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span> is defined (recursively) by: <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
    \textrm{Basis Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } x \in \underline{\phantom{\hspace{2in}}} \textrm{, then } x \in S_8\\
    \textrm{Recursive Step: } &amp; \textrm{If } s \in S_8 \textrm{ and } x \in C_8 \textrm{, then }
    \underline{\phantom{\hspace{2in}}} \in S_8
    \end{array}\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>) Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(v_8: S_8 \to \mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> defined recursively by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basis Step: If <span class="math inline">\(x \in C_8\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(v_8 (x) = x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recursive Step: If <span class="math inline">\(s \in S_8\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \in C_8\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(v_8 (sx) = 8v_8(s) + x\)</span>, where the input <span class="math inline">\(sx\)</span> is the result of string concatenation and the output <span class="math inline">\(8 v_8 (s)\)</span> is the result of integer multiplication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calculate <span class="math inline">\(v_8(104)\)</span>, including all steps in your calculation and justifications for them.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) It turns out<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> that for any string <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(S_8\)</span>, the value of the octal expansion <span class="math inline">\((u)_8\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(v_8(u)\)</span>. Using this fact, write an expression relating the value of <span class="math inline">\((u000)_8\)</span> to the value of <span class="math inline">\((u)_8\)</span> and justify it.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Recall that, mathematically, a color can be represented as a <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\((r, g, b)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> represents the red component, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the green component, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the blue component and where each of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must be from the collection <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in \mathbb{N}\mid 0 \leq x \leq 255 \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an <span><strong>alternative</strong></span> representation, in this assignment we’ll use base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width expansions to represent colors as single numbers.</p>
<p><span><strong>Definition</strong></span>: A <span><strong>hex color</strong></span> is a nonnegative integer less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(16777215\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a hex color, we define its red, green, and blue components by first writing its base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> expansion <span class="math display">\[n = (r_1r_2g_1g_2b_1b_2)_{16,6}\]</span> and then defining <span class="math inline">\((r_1r_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the red component, <span class="math inline">\((g_1g_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the green component, and <span class="math inline">\((b_1b_2)_{16,2}\)</span> is the blue component.</p>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the detail expected in your answer:</em></span></p>
<p>In RGB codes<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> white is represented as maximum red, maximum green, and maximum blue and so has <span class="math inline">\((FF)_{16,2}\)</span> as each of these components. This means that the hex color for white is <span class="math inline">\((FFFFFF)_{16,6}\)</span> which is the value <span class="math display">\[15\cdot 16^5 + 15 \cdot 16^4 + 15 \cdot 16^3 + 15 \cdot 16^2 + 15 \cdot 16^1 + 15 \cdot 16^0 
        = 16^6 - 1 = 16777215\]</span></p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>Write the hex color representing red (with no green or blue) in base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and also calculate its value (using usual mathematical conventions). Include your (clear, correct, complete) calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the hex color representing green (with no red or blue) in base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and also calculate its value (using usual mathematical conventions). Include your (clear, correct, complete) calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the hex color representing blue (with no red or green) in base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and also calculate its values (using usual mathematical conventions). Include your (clear, correct, complete) calculations.</p></li>
<li><p>The human eye can’t distinguish between some hex colors because of physical limitations. Give an example of two hex colors <span class="math inline">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_2\)</span> such that they look indistinguishable (the colors they represent are very very similar) but <span class="math display">\[c_1 - c_2 &gt; 50000\]</span> Justify your choice with (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references to definitions, and connecting these calculations and/or definitions with the desired properties. Include squares with each of your two colors so that we can see how indistinguishable they are.</p>
<p>Pro tip: To show a color, you can use the following LaTeX source code:</p>
<p><code>\definecolor{UCSDaccent}{RGB}{0,198,215}</code></p>
<p><code>\textcolor{UCSDaccent}{\rule{1cm}{1cm}}</code></p>
<p>which produces</p>
<div style="color: UCSDaccent">
<hr />
</div>
<p>Notice that the code to define the color uses the decimal-like values for each of the red, green, and blue components. For the UCSD accent color we defined, the base <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> fixed-width <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> values are: red is <span class="math inline">\((00)_{16,2}\)</span>, green is <span class="math inline">\((C6)_{16,2}\)</span>, blue is <span class="math inline">\((D7)_{16,2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Extra; not for credit:</em></span> What does this mean about the choice of hex color for representing colors? What are advantages and disadvantages of this representation?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) In class (Week 2 notes page 7), we discussed fixed-width addition. In this question we will look at fixed-width multiplication. The algorithm for fixed-width multiplication is to multiply using the usual long-multiplication algorithm (column-by-column and carry), and dropping all leftmost columns so the result is the same width as the input terms. For each of the examples below, consider whether this algorithm gives the correct value for the product of the two numbers, based on the way the bitstrings are interpreted.</p>

<p>First, we calculate the values: <span class="math display">\[[00101]_{2c,5} = 0\cdot (-2^4) + 0\cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0\cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 = 4 + 1 = 5\]</span> so the correct value for the product is <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 5 = 25\)</span>, which cannot be represented in 2s complement width 5 (the largest positive number that can be represented in 2s complement width 5 is <span class="math inline">\([01111]_{2c,5} = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15\)</span>).</p>

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will consider how circuits and logic can be used to represent mathematical and technical claims. You will use propositional and predicate logic to evaluate these claims.</p>
<p>Instructions and academic integrity reminders for all homework assignments in CSE20 this quarter are on the class website and on the hw1-definitions-and-notations assignment.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the assignment called “hw3-circuits-and-logic”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are working with for this assignment, see the class material from Week 3 and Week 4. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Imagine a friend suggests the following argument to you: “The compound proposition <span class="math display">\[(x \to y) \to z\]</span> is logically equivalent to <span class="math display">\[x \to (y \to z)\]</span> because I can transform one to the other using the following sequence of logical equivalences like distributivity and associativity and using that <span class="math inline">\((p \to q) \equiv (\lnot p \lor q)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[(x \to y) \to z \equiv
      \lnot (\lnot x \lor y) \lor z \equiv
      \lnot x \lor (\lnot y \lor z) \equiv
      x \to (\lnot y \lor z) \equiv x \to (y \to z)\]</span> so conditionals are associative just like conjunctions and disjunctions".</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>) Prove to your friend that they made a mistake by giving a truth assignment to the propositional variables where the two compound propositions <span class="math inline">\((x \to y) \to z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \to (y \to z)\)</span> have different truth values. Justify your choice by evaluating these compound propositions using the definitions of the logical connectives and include enough intermediate steps so that a student in CSE 20 who may be struggling with the material can still follow along with your reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>) Help your friend find the problem in their argument by pointing out which step(s) were incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) Give <span><strong>three</strong></span> different compound propositions that are actually logically equivalent to (and not the same as) <span class="math display">\[x \to (y \to z)\]</span> Justify each one of these logical equivalences either by applying a sequence of logical equivalences or using a truth table. Notice that you can use other logical operators (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(\lnot, \lor, \land, \oplus, \to, 
   \leftrightarrow\)</span>) when constructing your compound propositions.</p>
<p><span><em>Bonus; not for credit (do not hand in)</em></span>: How would you translate each of the equivalent compound propositions in English? Does doing so help illustrate why they are equivalent?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>For each part of this question you will use the following input-output definition table with four inputs <span class="math inline">\(x_3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span></p>

<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain, evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is true, we can take an arbitrary element <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of disjuction using equivalent conditional</strong></span>: To prove that the disjunction <span class="math inline">\(p \lor q\)</span> is true, we can rewrite it equivalently as <span class="math inline">\(\lnot p \to q\)</span> and then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To disprove the statement, we will prove the universal statement that is logically equivalent to its negation. By universal generalization, <span><strong>choose</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> to be an <span><strong>arbitrary</strong></span> integer.

Then, since by <span><strong>case assumption</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; e\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(y = 0 \leq 1 \leq e\)</span>. Moreover, since <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y &gt; 1\)</span> is false and so (by the definition of <span class="math inline">\(Pr\)</span>), the predicate <span class="math inline">\(Pr\)</span> evaluated at <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is false, as required to prove the <span><strong>conjunction</strong></span> <span class="math inline">\(y \leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span>. <span><strong>Case 2</strong></span>: Assume <span class="math inline">\(e \leq 1\)</span> and <span><strong>WTS</strong></span> there is a witness integer <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y \leq e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lnot Pr(y)\)</span>. Choose <span class="math inline">\(y = e-1\)</span>, an integer (because subtracting <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from the integer <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> still gives an integer).

<p><span><em>Sample response that can be used as reference for the detail expected in your answers for this question:</em></span></p>
<p>To give a witness for the existential claim <span class="math display">\[\exists B \in W~( B \in ~\{ X \in W ~|~ 1 \in X \} \cap \{ X \in W ~|~  2 \in X \}~~)\]</span> consider <span class="math inline">\(B = \{ 1,2\}\)</span>. To prove that this is a valid witness, we need to show that it is in the domain of quantification <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and that it makes the predicate being quantified evaluate to true. By definition of set-builder notation and intersection, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\} \in W\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(1 \in \{1,2\}\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(2 \in \{1,2\}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>By definition of power set, elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> are subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>. Since each element in <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2\}\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\)</span> and hence is an element of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.</p></li>

<li><p>Similarly, by definition of roster method, <span class="math inline">\(2 \in \{1,2\}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(B = \{1,2\}\)</span> is an element of the domain which is in the intersection of the two sets mentioned in the predicate being quantified and is a witness to the existential claim. QED</p>

<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain, evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is true, we can take an arbitrary element <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of disjuction using equivalent conditional</strong></span>: To prove that the disjunction <span class="math inline">\(p \lor q\)</span> is true, we can rewrite it equivalently as <span class="math inline">\(\lnot p \to q\)</span> and then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Structural Induction</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in X \, P(x)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a recursively defined set, prove two cases:</p>

<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Contradiction</strong></span></p>
<p>To prove that a statement <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true, pick another statement <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and once we show that <span class="math inline">\(\neg p  \to (r \wedge  \neg r)\)</span> then we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true.</p>

<p>Fill in the missing parts of the proof of this statement:<br />
<span><strong>Proof</strong></span>: We proceed by mathematical induction on the set of positive integers.</p>
<p><span><strong>Basis Step</strong></span>: Choose <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span> as the basis step. Using the Basis Step in the recursive definiton of <span class="math inline">\(sumOfFirst\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(sumOfFirst(1) = 1\)</span>. Plugging <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> into the RHS of the desired formula, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1 (1+1)}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1\)</span>. Since LHS=RHS, the Basis step is complete.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recursive Step</strong></span>: Consider an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(k \geq 1\)</span>. We assume (as the induction hypothesis) that <u>fill in the blank here</u>.</p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for fair effort completeness</em></span>) When calculating the runtime of an algorithm, nested for loops sometimes lead to program runtimes that involve the sum of the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> positive integers.

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice determining and justifying whether statements are true in multiple contexts.</p>
<p>Instructions and academic integrity reminders for all homework assignments in CSE20 this quarter are on the class website and on the hw1-definitions-and-notations assignment.</p>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the assignment called “hw6-proofs-numbers-cardinality”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics you are working with for this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 6 through 8. We will post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza post.</p>
<p>In your proofs and disproofs of statements below, justify each step by reference to a component of the following proof strategies we have discussed so far, and/or to relevant definitions and calculations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A counterexample can be used to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>false</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A witness can be used to prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>true</strong></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of universal by exhaustion</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is true when <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a finite domain, evaluate the predicate at <span><strong>each</strong></span> domain element to confirm that it is always T.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by universal generalization</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \, P(x)\)</span> is true, we can take an arbitrary element <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> from the domain and show that <span class="math inline">\(P(e)\)</span> is true, without making any assumptions about <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> other than that it comes from the domain.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\exists x P(x)\)</span> is <span><strong>false</strong></span>, write the universal statement that is logically equivalent to its negation and then prove it true using universal generalization.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Strategies for conjunction</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is true, have two subgoals: subgoal (1) prove <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true; and, subgoal (2) prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is false. To prove that <span class="math inline">\(p \land q\)</span> is false, it’s enough to prove that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is false.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Direct Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of Conditional by Contrapositive Proof</strong></span>: To prove that the implication <span class="math inline">\(p \to q\)</span> is true, we can assume <span class="math inline">\(\neg q\)</span> is true and use that assumption to show <span class="math inline">\(\neg p\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof of disjuction using equivalent conditional</strong></span>: To prove that the disjunction <span class="math inline">\(p \lor q\)</span> is true, we can rewrite it equivalently as <span class="math inline">\(\lnot p \to q\)</span> and then use direct proof or contrapositive proof.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Cases</strong></span>: To prove <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> when we know <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \lor p_2\)</span>, show that <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \to q\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_2 \to q\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Structural Induction</strong></span>: To prove that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in X \, P(x)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a recursively defined set, prove two cases:</p>

<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Strong Induction</strong></span> To prove that a universal quantification over the set of all integers greater than or equal to some base integer <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> holds, pick a fixed nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> and then:</p>

<li><p><span><strong>Proof by Contradiction</strong></span></p>
<p>To prove that a statement <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true, pick another statement <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and once we show that <span class="math inline">\(\neg p  \to (r \wedge  \neg r)\)</span> then we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is true.</p>

By the theorem we proved in class, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\)</span>.

        \end{cases}\]</span> This function is well-defined because each ratings <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples is mapped to a unique base. However, this function is not one-to-one, as we can see from the counterexample: <span class="math inline">\(a = (1,1,1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b = (1, 0,0)\)</span>. These are ratings <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-tuples (in the domain) which are distinct (they disagree about the second and third movies) but <span class="math display">\[g(a) = g(~(1,1,1)~) = \texttt{A}= g(~(1,0,0)~) = g(b)\]</span> because the two ratings agree on the first movie. Distinct domain elements getting mapped to the same codomain elements is a counterexample to injectivity.</p>
<p>The function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is also not onto, as we can see from the counterexample <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{U}\)</span>. This is an element of the codomain which is not <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the domain, as we can see from the piecewise definition of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, where in no case do we have the output value <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{U}\)</span>.</p>

<p>The project component of this class will be an opportunity for you to extend your work on assignments and explore applications of your choosing.</p>
<p><span><em>Why?</em></span> To go deeper and explore the material from discrete math and how it relates to Computer Science.</p>
<p><span><em>How?</em></span> During emergency remote instruction last academic year, we discovered that video assessement and some open-ended personalized projects help ensure fairness and can be less stressful for students than in-person midterm exams. Asynchronous project submission also gives flexibility and allows more physical distancing.</p>
<p>Your videos: We will delete all the videos we receive from you after assigning final grades for the course, and they will be stored in a university-controlled Google Drive directory only accessible to the course staff during the quarter. Please send an email to the instructor (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu) if you have concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU" class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU</a>.</p>
<p>The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxJN6CQcXqIbOekDYMxjh7mTt1TyRVMl" class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxJN6CQcXqIbOekDYMxjh7mTt1TyRVMl</a></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources can you use?</h2>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support if you get stuck with screencast).</p>
<p>You can use any of this quarter’s CSE 20 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback). These resources should be more than enough. If you are struggling to get started and want to look elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this by listing and citing any resources you consult (even if you do not explicitly quote them). Link directly to them and include the name of the author / video creator and the reason you consulted this reference. The work you submit for the project needs to be your own. Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than this quarter’s material and doing so may result in definitions or notations that conflict with our norms in this class so think carefully before you go down this path.</p>
<p>The project has three parts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 of Project: due Thursday October 14</p></li>
<li><p>Part 2 of Project: due Thursday November 4</p></li>
<li><p>Part 3 of Project: due Thursday December 2</p></li>

<h3 class="unnumbered" id="written-component">Written component</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>In Week 1, we discussed the mathematical definition of a function, namely that a <span><strong>function</strong></span> is defined by its (1) domain, (2) codomain, and (3) rule assigning each element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write out the definition for an example function you make up. You can choose any example you like, so long as it is your own independent effort and it is not a function from a class example, homework, or Review Quiz in this class so far. Use the notation defined in class. Label and define the domain, codomain, and rule clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the result of applying your function to an element in its domain. Just like in homework, include (clear, correct, complete) calculations and/or references to definitions to present your function application.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In CSE 20 this quarter, we will be exploring the applications of discrete mathematics for core CS topics. The following videos introduce some of these topics and the work happening here at UCSD to explore them. Pick one of the following videos, watch it, and then write a few sentences answering the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Which video did you watch? Why did you choose the video you watched?</p></li>
<li><p>What followup question(s) would you like to ask the person in the video about their work? At least one of your followup questions should be about a technical aspect of the work that you would like to learn more about.</p></li>

<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills.</p>
<p>Prepare a 3-5 minute screencast video that starts with your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s you creating the video and doing the work submitted for the project.</p>
<p>Then, explain your work in question 1 of the written component. Discuss at least one potential mistake that someone solving a similar question should avoid (this could be a mistake you made while thinking about this problem or something you anticipate a classmate might struggle with); explain why the mistake is wrong and how to fix it.</p>
<p>Finally, explain any differences between your pre-survey description of “what a function is" and the mathematical definition of what a function is. You should have an email copy of your responses to the pre-survey, and you can refer to what you wrote in your explanation.</p>

<li><p>In this part of the project, you will select one question from one of the review quizzes from 10/4/2021 (Monday of Week 1) to 10/29/2021 (Friday of Week 5) to revisit. Include the problem statement, why you picked this question (e.g. what is interesting about it, what is hard about it, or why you wanted to take a second look at it), and your solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question selection: you can pick any <span><strong>one question</strong></span> listed in the Review sections of the relevant notes documents, and you must address all of its parts.</p></li>
<li><p>For each part of your chosen question: prepare a complete solution (you can use the homework solutions we post for guidance about the style). Your submission will be evaluated not only on the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Your goal should be to convince the reader that your results and methods are sound. Imagine you are preparing these solutions for someone else taking CSE 20 who missed that week and is “catching up".</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In this part of the project, you’ll consider the importance of data types and precision in Computer Science. Read three articles</p>
