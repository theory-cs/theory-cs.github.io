<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>

</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a

<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Strings and languages: finding examples and edge
cases</strong> (12 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Give five (different) example alphabets that are meaningful or useful to
you in some way. Specify them formally, either with roster notation
(which means listing all and only distict elements between <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span> and separated by commas) or with
another approach to precisely define all and only the elements of the
alphabet.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give an example
of a finite set over an alphabet and an infinite set over an alphabet.
You get to choose the alphabet, and you get to choose the sets. The goal
is to practice communicating your choices and definitions with clear and
precise notation. One habit that will be useful (for this course, and
beyond), is to think of your response for each question as a well-formed
paragraph: include all the information that is relevant so that your
solution is self-contained, and so that each sentence is grammatically
constructed.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Define an alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> and an
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and a language
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> that is also a language over
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and a language <span
class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> that is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> a language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span>. A complete and correct answer
will use clear and precise notation (consistent with the textbook and
class notes) and will include a description of why the given example
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is a language over both <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and a description of why the
given example <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> is a language
over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma_2\)</span> and not over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Regular expressions</strong> (20 points):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Give three
regular expressions that all describe the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b\}\)</span> that have odd length. Ungraded
bonus challenge: Make the expressions as different as possible!</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) A friend tells
you that each regular expression that has a Kleene star (<span
class="math inline">\(~^*\)</span>) describes an infinite language. Are
they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a
counterexample to disprove it and explain your counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) For this question,
the alphabet is <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>. A friend
is trying to design a regular expression that describes the set of all
strings over this alphabet that end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Classify each of the following
attempts as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Correct. Explain why.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Type 1: Incorrect, because (even though each string that is
in the language described by the regular expression ends in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>) there is a string that ends in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> that is not in the language described
by the regular expression. Give this example string and explain why it
proves we’re in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Type 2: Incorrect, because (even though each string that
ends in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in the language
described by the regular expression), there is a string in the language
described by the regular expression that does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. Give this example string and explain
why it proves we’re in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Error Type 3: Incorrect, because there are two counterexample
strings, one which is a string that ends in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> that is not in the language described
by the regular expression and one which is in the language described by
the regular expression but does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.Give both example strings and describe
why each has the given property.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><span><em>Worked example for reference:</em></span> Consider the
regular expression <span class="math inline">\((a\cup b\cup
c)^*\)</span>. This regular expression has <span><strong>Error Type
2</strong></span> because it describes the set of all strings over <span
class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>, so even though each string
that ends in <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in this language,
there is an example, say <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span> that is
a string in the language described by the regular expression (because we
consider the string formed as a result of the Kleene star operation
which has 2 slots and where the first slot matches the <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(a \cup b
\cup c\)</span> and the second slot matches <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(a \cup b
\cup c\)</span>) but does not end in <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (it ends in <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>).</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><p>The regular expression is <span class="math display">\[(a\cup
b)^* \circ c\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The regular expression is <span class="math display">\[(a \circ b
\circ c)^*\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The regular expression is <span class="math display">\[a^*c
~\cup~ b^*c ~\cup~ c^*c\]</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Functions over languages</strong> (18 points):</p>
<p>For each language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over an
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the
associated sets of strings (also over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span class="math display">\[L^*
= \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in
L\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in
\Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy
\in L\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in
\Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in
\Sigma^* \}\]</span> Also, recall the set operations union and
intersection: for any sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <span class="math display">\[X
\cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y
\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Specify an
example language <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(A) = EXTEND(A)\]</span> or explain why
there is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(A)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(EXTEND(A)\)</span> (using the given definitions)
to justify this description and to justify the set equality, or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
language <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(B) \cap EXTEND(B) =
\{\varepsilon\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(B)
\cup EXTEND(B) = \{0,1\}^*\]</span> or explain why there is no such
example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear
description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(B)\)</span>, <span

to justify this description and to justify the set equality with <span
class="math inline">\(\{\varepsilon\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> (respectively), or (2) a
sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such example,
referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
<span><strong>infinite</strong></span> language <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(C) \neq \{0,1\}^*\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(C) = C^*\]</span>or explain why there
is no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a
precise and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(C)\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(C^*\)</span> (using the given definitions) to
justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims, or
(2) a sufficiently general and correct argument why there is no such
example, referring back to the relevant definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Specify an example
<span><strong>finite</strong></span> language <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(D) \neq \{0,1\}^*\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[EXTEND(D) = D^*\]</span>or explain why there is
no such example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise
and clear description of your example language <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and a precise and clear description of
the result of computing <span class="math inline">\(EXTEND(D)\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(D^*\)</span> (using the given definitions)
to justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims,

<li><p><strong>Automata design</strong> (12 points): As background to
this question, recall that integers can be represented using base <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansions, for any convenient choice
of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. The precise definition
is: for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> an integer greater than
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> a positive integer, the
<span><strong>base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></strong></span> is defined to be
<span class="math display">\[(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\]</span> where
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a positive integer, <span
class="math inline">\(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}\)</span> are nonnegative
integers less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{k-1} \neq  0\)</span>, and <span
class="math display">\[n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice: <span><em>The base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansion of a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
is a string over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in
\mathbb{Z} \mid 0 \leq x &lt; b\}\)</span> whose leftmost character is
nonzero.</em></span></p>
<p>An important property of base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
expansions of integers is that, for each integer <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> greater than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, each positive integer <span
class="math inline">\(n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b\)</span>, and each
nonnegative integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> less than
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[bn
+ a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b\]</span> In other words, shifting the
base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> expansion to the left
results in multiplying the integer value by the base. In this question
we’ll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.</p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Design a DFA that

plays in the machine, as well as a brief justification about how the

<p><span><em>Hints</em></span>: (1) A power of <span

class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that can be written as <span

but <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> and <span

<li><p><strong>General constructions</strong> (13 points): In this
question, you’ll practice working with formal general constructions for
automata and translating between state diagrams and formal
definitions.</p>
<p>Recall the definitions of operations we’ve talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over an alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the associated sets of
strings (also over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span

<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will demonstrate the richness of the class of regular languages,
as well as its boundaries, and explore push-down automata and their
design.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Week 3 and Week 4. We will
post frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned

<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>On the “graded for correctness" questions, you may only
collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group. You may ask questions
about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or
tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Static analysis</strong> (10 points): In software
engineering, static analysis is an approach to debugging and testing
where the properties of a piece of code are inferred without actually
running it. In the context of finite automata, we can think of static
analysis as the process of inferring properties of the language
recognized by a finite automaton from properties of the graph underlying
its state diagram. The Pumping Lemma is one example of static analysis.
In this question, you’ll explore other examples of how properties of the
graph underlying the state diagram of a machine can give us information
about the language recognized by the machine.</p>

<li><p><strong>Regular and nonregular languages</strong> (12 points): In
Week 2’s review quiz, we saw the definition that a set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is said to be <span><strong>closed
under an operation</strong></span> if, for any elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, applying to them gives an element in
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For example, the set of integers
is closed under multiplication because if we take any two integers,
their product is also an integer .</p>
<p>Recall the definitions of operations we’ve talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> over an alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the associated sets of
strings (also over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>) <span
class="math display">\[L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{
and each } w_i \in L\}\]</span> and <span
class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there
exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}\]</span> and
<span class="math display">\[EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv
\text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^*
\}\]</span> Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for
any sets <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> <span class="math display">\[X \cup Y =
\{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y
\}\]</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Use the general
constructions that we developed to prove the closure of the class of
regular languages under various operations to produce the state diagram
of a NFA that recognizes the language <span

<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. On the “graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group;
if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help
hours or post a private post (visible only to the Instructors) on
Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you may collaborate
with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public
posts about these questions on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>On the “graded for correctness" questions, you may only
collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group. You may ask questions
about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or
tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so

<li><p><strong>General constructions for context-free languages</strong>
(15 points):</p>
<p>In class in week 5, we described several general constructions with
PDAs and CFGs, leaving their details to homework. In this question,
we’ll fill in these details. The first constructions help us prove that
the class of regular languages is a subset of the class of context-free
languages. The other construction allows us to make simplifying
assumptions about PDAs recognizing languages.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) When we first
introduced PDAs we observed that any NFA can be transformed to a PDA by
not using the stack of the PDA at all. Suppose a friend gives you the
following construction to formalize this transformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a NFA <span class="math inline">\(N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta_N,
q_0, F)\)</span> we define a PDA <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(L(M) = L(N)\)</span> by letting <span
class="math inline">\(M = ( Q, \Sigma, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\delta(~(q,a,b)~) =
\delta_N(~(q,a)~)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(q \in
Q\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a \in
\Sigma_{\varepsilon}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \in
\Sigma_{\varepsilon}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For each of the six defining parameters for the PDA, explain whether
it’s defined correctly or not. If it is not defined correctly, explain
why not and give a new definition for this parameter that corrects the
mistake.</p></li>

converting DFAs to CFGs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can convert any DFA into an equivalent CFG as follows. Make a
variable <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> for each state <span
class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> of the DFA. Add the rule <span
class="math inline">\(R_i \to aR_j\)</span> to the CFG if <span
class="math inline">\(\delta(q_i,a) =q_j\)</span> is a transition in the
DFA. Add the rule <span class="math inline">\(R_i\to
\varepsilon\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is an
accept state of the DFA. Make <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>
the start variable ofthe grammar, where <span
class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> is the start state of the machine.
Verify on your own that the resulting CFG generates the same language
that the DFA recognizes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use this construction to get a context-free grammar generating the
language <span class="math display">\[\{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w \text{
has at least one $a$ and does not end in  $bb$}\}\]</span> by (1)
designing a DFA that recognizes this language and then (2) applying the
construction from the book to convert the DFA to an equivalent CFG. A
complete and correct submission will include the state diagram of the
DFA, a brief justification of why it recognizes the language, and then
the complete and precise definition of the CFG that results from
applying the construction from the book to this DFA. <span><em>Ungraded
bonus: take a sample string in the language and see how the computation
of the DFA on this string translates to a derivation in your
grammar.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1,
\delta_1, q_1, F_1)\)</span> be a PDA and let <span
class="math inline">\(q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}\)</span> be three fresh
state labels (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(Q_1 \cap \{q_{new},
r_{new}, s_{new}\} = \emptyset\)</span>) and let <span
class="math inline">\(\#\)</span> be a fresh stack symbol (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(\# \notin \Gamma_1\)</span>). We define the PDA
<span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> as <span
class="math display">\[(Q_2, \Sigma, \Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_{new},
\{s_{new}\})\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(Q_2 = Q_1 \cup
\{q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}\}\)</span> and <span

{\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon \to
\mathcal{P}(Q_2 \times {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon)\)</span> given by <span

\{(s_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &amp;\text{if } q= r_{new}, a = \varepsilon,

\Sigma_{\varepsilon}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b \in

<p>In this question, we’ll apply this construction for a specific PDA
and use this example to extrapolate the effect of this construction.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Consider the PDA
<span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> with input alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and stack alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1, \$\}\)</span> whose state diagram is</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Draw the state diagram for the PDA <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> that results from applying the
construction to <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>. Also, give an
example string of length <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> that is
accepted by both <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and justify your choice by describing
an accepting computation for each of the PDAs on your input
string.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Compare <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_1)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_2)\)</span>. Are these sets equal? Does your
answer depend on the specific choice of <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>? Why or why not?</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Consider the PDA
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> with input alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and stack alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> whose state diagram is</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>Remember that the definition of set-wise concatenation is: for
languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> over the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, we have the
associated set of strings <span class="math display">\[L_1 \circ L_2 =
\{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{
and } v \in L_2 \}\]</span> In class, we discussed how extrapolating the
construction that we used to prove that the class of regular languages
is closed under set-wise concatenation by drawing spontaneous
transitions from the accepting states in the first machine to the start
state of the second machine doesn’t work. Use the example of <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to prove this by showing that <span
class="math display">\[L(M_1) \circ L(N)\]</span> is
<span><strong>not</strong></span> the language recognized by the machine
results from taking the two machines <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, setting the start state of <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> to be the start state of the new
machine, setting the set of accepting states of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to be the set of accepting states of
the new machine, and drawing spontaneous arrows from the accepting
states of <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> to the start state of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Then, describe the language
recognized by the machine that results from taking the two machines
<span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, setting the start state of <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> to be the start state of the new
machine, setting the set of accepting states of <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> to be the set of accepting states of
the new machine, and drawing spontaneous arrows from the accepting
states of <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> to the start state of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Use this description to explain
why we used the construction of <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>
from <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and how this construction
could be used in a proof of the closure of the class of context-free
languages under set-wise concatenation.</p>
<p>A complete response will give an example string that witnesses that
<span class="math inline">\(L(M_1) \circ L(N)\)</span> is not equal to
the language recognized by the PDA resulting from the wrong construction
(described above) <span><strong>and</strong></span> the state diagram of
the PDA that results from applying that construction to <span
class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (instead of <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>), with a brief justification about
why that approach works.</p></li>

Turing machine is <span><strong>never halts</strong></span> or explain
why there is no such example. A complete solution will include either
(1) a precise and clear description of your example string and a precise

</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Classifying languages</strong> (8 points): Our first
example of a more complicated Turing machine was of a Turing machine
that recognized the language <span class="math inline">\(\{w \# w \mid w
\in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span> (Figure 3.10 in the textbook), which we know is
not context-free. Let’s call that Turing machine <span
class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span>. The language <span
class="math display">\[L = \{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}\]</span> is also
not context-free.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Choose an example

<span><strong>not</strong></span> in <span class="math inline">\(\{w \#
w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span> and describe the computation of the
Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_0\)</span> on your example
string. Include the contents of the tape, the state of the machine, and
the location of the read/write head at each step in the

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Explain why the
Turing machine from the textbook and class that recognized <span
class="math inline">\(\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span> does not
recognize <span class="math inline">\(\{ww \mid w \in

Turing machine that does recognize <span

both an implementation-level definition and a state diagram of the
Turing machine. You may use all our usual conventions for state diagrams
of Turing machines (we do not include the node for the reject state
<span class="math inline">\(qrej\)</span> and any missing transitions in
the state diagram have value <span
