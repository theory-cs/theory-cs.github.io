<h1 class="title">HW1CSE105W25: Homework assignment 1</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105F24</p>
<p class="date">Due: January 16th at 5pm, via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span></p>
<p>You will practice reading and applying the definitions of alphabets,
strings, languages, Kleene star, and regular expressions. You will use
regular expressions and relate them to languages and finite automata.
You will use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of
finite automata, and you will use clear English to describe computations
of finite automata informally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 0 and 1. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Section 0, 1.3, 1.1. Chapter 1 exercises 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.18,
1.23.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines,you
can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture environment (see templates in the
class notes), or (2)) use the software tools Flap.js or JFLAP described
in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you
can carefully and clearly hand-draw the diagram and take a picture and
include it in your PDF. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw1CSE105W25”.</p>
