<h1 class="title">HW4CSE105W24: Homework assignment 4</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105W24</p>
<p class="date">Due: February 29th at 5pm (no penalty late submission
until 8am next morning), via Gradescope</p>
</header>
<p><span><strong>In this assignment,</strong></span> You will practice
analyzing, designing, and working with Turing machines. You will use
general constructions and specific machines to explore the classes of
recognizable and decidable languages. You will explore various ways to
encode machines as strings so that computational problems can be
recognized.</p>
<p><span><strong>Resources</strong></span>: To review the topics for
this assignment, see the class material from Weeks 5-7. We will post
frequently asked questions and our answers to them in a pinned Piazza
post.</p>
<p><span><strong>Reading and extra practice problems</strong></span>:
Sipser Sections 3.1, 3.3, 4.1 Chapter 3 exercises 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.8.
Chapter 4 exercises 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5.</p>
<p><span><strong>For all HW assignments:</strong></span> Weekly homework
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. You may
switch HW partners for different HW assignments. Please ensure your
name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your
homework submission and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in
a group, submit only one submission per group: one partner uploads the
submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other
group member(s) to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s)
in the “Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your
group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your
assignment. Each homework question will be graded either for correctness
(including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all
answers) or fair effort completeness. For “graded for correctness”
questions: collaboration is allowed only with CSE 105 students in your
group; if your group has questions about a problem, you may ask in
drop-in help hours or post a private post (visible only to the
Instructors) on Piazza. For “graded for completeness” questions:
collaboration is allowed with any CSE 105 students this quarter; if your
group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours
or post a public post on Piazza.</p>
<p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. You can use a
word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office,
Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) but you might find it useful to take
this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used widely
in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignments are typed
using LaTeX and you can use the source files as templates for
typesetting your solutions. To generate state diagrams of machines, we
recommend using Flap.js or JFLAP. Photographs of clearly hand-drawn
diagrams may also be used. We recommend that you submit early drafts to
Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some
of your work is present. You may update your submission as many times as
you’d like up to the deadline.</p>
<p><span><strong>Integrity reminders</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the
partners. The homework is designed to give you practice with the main
concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to know and learn
from your classmates.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not collaborate on homework questions graded for
correctness with anyone other than your group members. You may ask
questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs,
and/or tutors) and on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the
Instructors). You <em>cannot</em> use any online resources about the
course content other than the class material from this quarter – this is
primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and definitions
(aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience
you will have when the ‘aha’ moments of solving the problem
authentically happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework
with other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so
would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in
the class.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will submit this assignment via Gradescope (<a
href="https://www.gradescope.com">https://www.gradescope.com</a>) in the
assignment called “hw4CSE105W24”.</p>
<p><span><strong>Assigned questions</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Classifying languages</strong> (10 points): Our first
example of a more complicated Turing machine was of a Turing machine
that recognized the language <span class="math inline">\(\{w \# w \mid w
\in\{0,1\}^*\}\)</span>, which we know is not context-free. The language
<span class="math display">\[\{0^n 1^n 2^n \mid n \geq 0\}\]</span> is
also not context-free.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
Give an implementation-level description of a Turing machine that
recognizes this language.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Draw a state diagram of the Turing machine you gave in part (a) and
trace the computation of this Turing machine on the input <span
class="math inline">\(012\)</span>. You may use all our usual
conventions for state diagrams of Turing machines (we do not include the
node for the reject state <span class="math inline">\(qrej\)</span> and
any missing transitions in the state diagram have value <span
class="math inline">\((qrej,\square,R)\)</span>; <span
class="math inline">\(b \to R\)</span> label means <span
class="math inline">\(b \to b, R\)</span> ).</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Deciders, Recognizers, Decidability, and
Recognizability</strong> (15 points): For this question, consider the
alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Give an example of
a finite, nonempty language over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> and two different Turing machines
that recognize it: one that is a decider and one that is not. A complete
solution will include a precise definition for your example language,
along with <span><strong>both</strong></span> a state diagram and an
implementation-level description of each Turing machines, along with a
brief explanation of why each of them recognizes the language and why
one is a decider and there other is not.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) True or false:
There is a Turing machine that is not a decider that recognizes the
empty set. A complete solution will include a witness Turing machine
(given by state diagram or implementation-level description or
high-level description) and a justification for why it’s not a decider
and why it does not accept any strings, or a complete and correct
justification for why there is no such Turing machine.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) True or false:
There is a Turing machine that is not a decider that recognizes the set
of all string <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>. A complete
solution will include a witness Turing machine (given by state diagram
or implementation-level description or high-level description) and a
justification for why it’s not a decider and why it accept each string
over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>, or a complete and
correct justification for why there is no such Turing machine.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Closure</strong> (15 points): Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a Turing machine over the alphabet
<span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \ldots\)</span> be a list of all strings
in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in string (shortlex)
order. We define a new Turing machine by giving its high-level
description as follows: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
   M_{new} &amp;= ``\text{On input }w:\\
    &amp;\text{1. For $n = 1, 2, \ldots$}\\
    &amp;\text{2.~~~For $j = 1, 2, \ldots n$} \\
    &amp;\text{3.~~~For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$} \\
    &amp;\text{4.~~~~~~Run the computation of $M$ on $s_jws_k$}\\
    &amp;\text{5.~~~~~~If it accepts, accept.}\\
    &amp;\text{6.~~~~~~If it rejects, go to the next iteration of the
loop&quot;}\\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Recall the definitions we have: For languages <span
class="math inline">\(L_1, L_2\)</span> over the alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma = \{0,1\}\)</span>, we have the associated
sets of strings <span class="math display">\[SUBSTRING(L_1) = \{ w \in
\Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } a,b \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } awb
\in L_1\}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w
\in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and }
v \in L_2 \}\]</span> We say that self-set-wise concatenation of the set
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(L_1 \circ L_1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><em>Note: there was a bug in the version of this assignment
that was first released.</em></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Prove that this
Turing machine construction <span><strong>cannot</strong></span> be used
to prove that the class of decidable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under
<span><strong>either</strong></span> of the above operations (<span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span> or self-set-wise
concatenation). A complete answer will give a counterexample or general
description why the construction doesn’t work for both
operations.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for correctness</em></span>) Prove that this
Turing machine construction cannot be used to prove that the class of
recognizable languages over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span>
is closed under the <span class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span> set
operation. In particular, give a counterexample of a specific language
<span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and Turing machine <span
class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> recognizing it where <span
class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> does not recognize <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING(L_1)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Define a new
construction by slightly modifiying this one that can be used to prove
that the class of recognizable languages over <span
class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> is closed under <span
class="math inline">\(SUBSTRING\)</span>. Justify that your construction
works. The proof of correctness for the closure claim can be structured
like: “Let <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> be a recognizable
language over <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}\)</span> and assume we
are given a Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> so
that <span class="math inline">\(L(M_1) = L_1\)</span>. Consider the new
Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_{new}\)</span> defined
above. We will show that <span class="math inline">\(L(M_{new}) =
SUBSTRING(L_1)\)</span>... <span><em>complete the proof by proving
subset inclusion in two directions, by tracing the relevant Turing
machine computations</em></span>”</p></li>

definitions of some example computational problems from class</p>

<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Pick five of the
computational problems above and give examples (preferably different
from the ones we talked about in class) of strings that are in each of
the corresponding languages. Remember to use the notation <span
class="math inline">\(\langle \cdots \rangle\)</span> to denote the
string encoding of relevant objects. <span><em>Extension, not for
credit:</em></span> Explain why it’s hard to write a specific string of
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>s and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>s and make a claim about membership in
one of these sets.</p></li>
<li><p>(<span><em>Graded for completeness</em></span>) Computational
problems can also be defined about Turing machines. Consider the two
high-level descriptions of Turing machines below. Reverse-engineer them
to define the computational problem that is being recognized, where
<span class="math inline">\(L(M_{DFA})\)</span> is the language
corresponding to this computational problem about DFA and <span
class="math inline">\(L(M_{TM})\)</span> is the language corresponding
to this computational problem about Turing machines.
<span><em>Hint</em></span>: the computational problem is not acceptance,
language emptiness, or language equality (but is related to one of
them).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(s_1, s_2, \ldots\)</span> be a list
of all strings in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^*\)</span> in
string (shortlex) order. Consider the following Turing machines <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
        M_{DFA} &amp;= ``\text{On input $\langle D \rangle$ where $D$ is
a DFA}:\\

<li id="fn1"><p>This means your solution will be evaluated not only on
the correctness of your answers, but on your ability to present your
ideas clearly and logically. You should explain how you arrived at your
conclusions, using mathematically sound reasoning. Whether you use
formal proof techniques or write a more informal argument for why
something is true, your answers should always be well-supported. Your
goal should be to convince the reader that your results and methods are
sound.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn2"><p>This means you will get full credit so long as your
submission demonstrates honest effort to answer the question. You will
not be penalized for incorrect answers. To demonstrate your honest
effort in answering the question, we expect you to include your attempt
to answer *each* part of the question. If you get stuck with your
attempt, you can still demonstrate your effort by explaining where you
got stuck and what you did to try to get unstuck.<a href="#fnref2"
