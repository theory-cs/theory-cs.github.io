<h1 class="title">ProjectCSE105F24: Project</h1>
<p class="author">CSE105F24</p>
<p class="date">Due December 11, 2024 at 11am</p>
</header>
<p>The CSE 105 project is designed for you to go deeper and extend your
work on assignments and to see how some of the abstract notions we
discuss can be implemented in concrete ways. The project is an
individual assignment and has two tasks:</p>
<p>Task 1: Illustrating the decidability of a computational problem,
and</p>
<p>Task 2: Illustrating a mapping reduction</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="what-resources-can-you-use">What resources
can you use?</h3>
<p>This project must be completed individually, without any help from
other people, including the course staff (other than logistics support
if you get stuck with screencast). You can use any of this quarter’s CSE
105 offering (notes, readings, class videos, homework feedback). Tools
for drawing state diagrams (like Flap.js and JFLAP and the PrairieLearn
automata library) can be used to help draw the diagrams in the project
too.</p>
<p>These resources should be more than enough. If you are struggling to
get started and want to look elsewhere online, you must acknowledge this
by listing and citing any resources you consult (even if you do not
explicitly quote them), including any large-language model style
resources (ChatGPT, Bard, Co-Pilot, etc.). Link directly to them and
include the name of the author / video creator, any and all search
strings or prompts you used, and the reason you consulted this
reference. The work you submit for the project needs to be your own.
Again, you shouldn’t need to look anywhere other than this quarter’s
material and doing so may result in definitions that conflict with our
conventions in this class so think carefully before you go down this
path.</p>
<p>If you get stuck on any part of the project, we encourage you to
focus on communicating what you think the question might mean, including
bringing an example from class or homework you think might be relevant,
and include any submission any aspect where you’re unsure. Clear
communication about these theoretical ideas and their applications is
one of the main goals of the project.</p>
<p><span><strong>Submitting the project</strong></span> You will submit
a PDF plus a video file for the first task and a PDF plus a video fiile
for the second task. All file submissions will be in Gradescope.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="your-video">Your video:</h3>
<p>You may produce screencasts with any software you choose. One option
is to record yourself with Zoom; a tutorial on how to use Zoom to record
a screencast (courtesy of Prof. Joe Politz) is here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU"
class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU</a>.</p>
<p>The video that was produced from that recording session in Zoom is
here:</p>

<p>Please send an email to the instructors (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you have
concerns about the video / screencast components of this project or
cannot complete projects in this style for some reason.</p>

id="task-1-illustrating-the-decidability-of-a-computational-problem">Task
1: Illustrating the decidability of a computational problem</h3>
<p>Many computational problems are decidable, sometimes using beautiful
algorithms. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a
<span><strong>decidable</strong></span> computational problem, and
demonstrate the proof that it is decidable by building a program in a
programming language of your choice (aka a high-level description of a
Turing machine) that decides it. You will then demonstrate how your
construction works for some test examples.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a decidable computational problem from Section 4.1.
<span><em>Note: if you’d like to consider a different computational
problem instead, please check with Prof. Minnes first. You must do so no
later than the start of Week 9.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that decides this computational
problem. The function input must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span> and part of your work in this
program is to design string representations for arbitrary instances of
the model of computation the computational problem you picked is about
(e.g. DFA, NFA, regular expressions, CFG, or NFA). The function output
must be a <span><strong>boolean</strong></span> true (if the string is
in the set representing the computational problem) or false (if the
string is not in the set representing the computational problem).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may use our class notes and the textbook for ideas on the
algorithm that your program will implement.</p></li>
<li><p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT
to help you write this program. However, you should test the code that
is produced and be able to explain what it is doing. Your code needs to
be well-organized and well-documented. As a header in your code file,
include a comment block describing any resources that were used to help
generate your code, including any and all prompts used in interactions
with LLM coding tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, select one string that is in the set
representing the computational problem, and one string that is not in
the set representing the computational problem, explain why these
strings are valid examples, and demonstrate running your program on each
to get the appropriate output.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Presenting your reasoning and demonstrating it via screenshare are
important skills that also show us a lot of your learning. Getting
practice with this style of presentation is a good thing for you to
learn in general and a rich way for us to assess your skills. To
demonstrate your work, you will create a 3-5 minute screencast video
explaining your code design and demonstrating its functionality.</p>
<p><span><strong>Checklist for submission</strong></span> For this task,
you will submit a PDF plus a video file.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Writeup includes a clear specification of computational problem
being decided.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation for program deciding this computational problem:
include a description of how input strings are parsed to represent
instances of the computational problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear specification of two example strings, explaining which is
in the set (and why) and which is not in the set (and why not).</p></li>
<li><p>Project submission includes a printout of code for program
implementing algorithm to decide the computational problem, as well as
screen shots demonstrating running your program on your example
strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Project writeup is typed or clearly hand drawn with precise
language and notation for all terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Start with your face and your student ID visible for a few
seconds at the beginning, and introduce yourself audibly while on
screen. You don’t have to be on camera for the rest of the video, though
it’s fine if you are. We are looking for a brief confirmation that it’s
you creating the video and doing the work you submitted.</p></li>
<li><p>Present the computational problem you will be working with, and
example strings that you will be using, including explanations of why
you chose this problem and these strings (and why one of the strings is
in the set and why the other is not).</p></li>
<li><p>Show on the screen and explain the code for your program,
including the software design choices you made (e.g. which data
structures are you using, etc.) and any resources you used. The video
should clearly describe which programming language was chosen for the
implementation and gives the reasons why.</p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrate running your code on each of your example inputs. The
video should include screencasts of running the code live. Explain why
the output of your program is what you would expect, by connecting the
output of the the definition of the computational problem and your
chosen parsing of input strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Logistics: video needs to load correctly, be between 3 and 5
minutes, show your face and ID, and you introduce yourself audibly while
on screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: Clarity and brevity are both
important aspects of your video. In previous years, we’ve seen students
speed up their videos to get below the 5 minute upper bound. This is ok
so long as it doesn’t compromise clarity. If the graders need to slow
your video down to understand it, it may not earn full credit.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="task-2-illustrating-a-mapping-reduction">Task
2: Illustrating a mapping reduction</h3>
<p>We can use mapping reductions to prove that interesting computational
problems are undecidable, building on the undecidability of other
computational problems. In this part of the project, you’ll choose a
specific <span><strong>mapping reduction</strong></span> and implement a
computable function that witnesses it using a programming language of
your choice (aka a high-level description of a Turing machine that
computes it). You will then demonstrate how your construction works for
some test examples.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a mapping reduction we discussed in class or in the
homework or in review quizzes or in the textbook where both sets being
compared are undecidable. <span><em>Note: if you’d like to consider a
mapping reduction we have not discussed instead, please check with Prof.
Minnes first. You must do so no later than the start of Week
9.</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Write a program in Java, Python, JavaScript, C++ , or another
programming language of your choosing that implements a computable
function witnessing this mapping reduction. The function input must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span> and the function output must be a
<span><strong>string</strong></span>. Part of your work in this program
is to design string representations for arbitrary instances of the model
of computation the computational problems being compared in the mapping
reduction. Your function will need to be able to process *any* string as
input.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may use our class notes and the textbook for ideas on the
algorithm that your program will implement.</p></li>
<li><p>If you would like, you may use aids such as co-pilot or ChatGPT
to help you write this program. However, you should test the code that
is produced and be able to explain what it is doing. Your code needs to
be well-organized and well-documented. As a header in your code file,
include a comment block describing any resources that were used to help
generate your code, including any and all prompts used in interactions
with LLM coding tools.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>To demonstrate your program, you will need to run it for an
example positive and negative instance. That is to say, if you are
implementing a computable function witnessing <span
class="math inline">\(X \leq_m Y\)</span>, you will select one string
that is in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and one string that is
not in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and you will demonstrate
running your program on each of these strings and explain why the output
of the function is good.</p></li>
