      <h2>$courseTitle</h2>
      <h3>
        Is there a problem that NO computer can ever solve?<br>

        What resources are needed to solve a problem?<br>

        Are some problems harder than others? <br>
      </h3>
      <p>In this course, we will explore what it means to be "computable".
      </p>
      <p>We begin with a very constrained model of
        computation, and work our way to the most powerful, the Turing machine. We'll see how remarkable
        this model is in terms of how much it captures about the capabilities of computation, even though
        it appears far removed from implementation.
        <strong>Alan Turing</strong>
        formalized the notion of "algorithm" using this model <i>even before there were any physical computers</i>.
        Remarkably, it is still relevant today and is equivalent to supercomputers and quantum computers!
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll also explore the relationship of these models to some essential tools in a computer
        scientist's toolkit, such as regular expressions and reductions. Throughout the course, you'll develop
        your technical communication skills in writing formal arguments and proofs.
      </p>
      <!-- Syllabus -->
      <h2>Syllabus</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>A typical week</dt>
        <dd>
          We'll meet in class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday. Each week, we'll release a packet of notes
          that we'll work through together during class. You can download a PDF of these notes to annotate, or you can
          pick up
          a printed version in class. The notes will also refer to textbook sections we ask you to read before class.
          Wednesday afternoons are discussion sections, where you can work through additional questions
          and review homework. Weekly review quizzes will test your understanding
          and prepare you to complete the weekly open-ended homework assignments. In addition to these quizzes and
          homework assignments, you'll 
          demonstrate what you learned in two in-person, self-scheduled tests, and you'll complete an individual, open-ended project.
          We recommend talking about CSE 105 concepts with other students, and with the instructional team
          in class, discussion, and drop-in office hours.
        </dd>
        </dt>
        <dt>Pre-class survey</dt>
        <dd>Please fill out the pre-class survey
          on <a href="http://canvas.ucsd.edu" aria-label="Go to Canvas" target="_blank">Canvas</a>  labelled #FinAid .
        </dd>
        <dt>Notes and resources</dt>
        <dd>Use our <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">Calendar</a> to get links to
          class times and notes. Lecture
          material is available in PDF, tex, and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
          it if you'd like. In class, we'll explore concepts and work through examples.
          There will often be some <a href="#textbook">pre-class reading</a> (listed on the notes PDF) to help you
          prepare for class.
          The reading is often just a few lines of text or an example in the book and will be very helpful so we can
          jump into
          problem solving in class. You can also watch the posted supplementary videos listed with
          <a href="overview_calendar.html" aria-label="Go to Calendar">each week</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt>Learn by doing</dt>
        <dd> After each class, you'll work on
          review quizzes to
          track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples we covered in class.
          Quizzes are on <a href="http://us.prairielearn.com"
          aria-label="Go to PrairieLearn" target="_blank">PrairieLearn</a>; we recommend completing
          the quiz questions for each week's material before the next week begins.
          Open-ended (group-optional) homework assignments will stretch your understanding and
          will ask you to put together complete, coherent, convincing explanations.
          You will upload PDFs of your typed solutions on <a href="http://gradescope.com"
          aria-label="Go to Gradescope" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.
          There will also be a project and two (in-person, self-scheduled at the
          <a href= "https://tritontesting.ucsd.edu/" aria-label="Go to Triton Testing Center homepage"
          target="_blank">Computer Based Testing Facility</a>) tests.
          In each of these <a href="#grades">assessments</a>
          you will practice using precise language to represent and solve technical
          problems and to communicate your solutions, and you will get feedback on your work.</dd>
        <dt>Collaborate</dt>
        <dd>
          In-class, in office hours, and on the online discussion board, we encourage you to discuss
          the course concepts and examples. Review quiz questions are open to collaboration with everyone
          in CSE 105.
          To get the maximum benefit from working on homework assignments, we encourage you to find a group
          to work with.
          Students in previous versions of the class often found group
          conversations helped them learn the material more deeply, and were fun
          (and also an <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3478431.3499286" target="_blank">evidence-based
            practice</a> for learning).
          To find group members: reach out to
          people sitting around you in class, in discussion section, or during office hours; you
          can also use the "find teammate" tool on <a href="https://piazza.com/ucsd/fall2024/cse105_fa24_a00/"
          aria-label="Piazza discussion board">Piazza</a>. The pre-survey
          asks if you want help finding group members: the CSE 105 instructional team can help you connect with
          other students. We highly recommend
          meeting synchronously so that your group can work through the homework problems *together*
          (<a href="https://students.ucsd.edu/campus-services/technology/campus-study-locations.html" target="_blank" )>
            in person</a> or online).
          Permitted collaboration is described in the <a href="#grades">grading and academic integrity</a>
          section.</dd>
        <dt>Ask for help</dt>
        <dd>Reach out to the CSE 105 team
          if you have questions. The CSE 105 instructional team this quarter is one instructor (Mia Minnes),
          two TAs,
          and eight tutors.
          On our <a href="http://canvas.ucsd.edu" aria-label="Go to Canvas" target="_blank">Canvas</a>  page, select "People" and filter by "Roles" to see our names, contact information, and brief
          profiles.
          This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion; you can access Piazza through our Canvas
          site or <a href="https://piazza.com/ucsd/fall2024/cse105_fa24_a00/"
            aria-label="Piazza discussion board">directly</a>
          (the Piazza roster is synced to the Registrar class list and waitlist). Drop-in (in person
          and Zoom) Q&A times are listed on the <a href="office_hours.html">office hours</a> page.
          You can also reach out to your instructor directly by email: minnes@ucsd.edu .
          <em>To address me, please use Prof. Minnes, Dr. Minnes,

    <!-- Resources -->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Resources</h2>

      <a name="textbook"></a>
      <h3>Textbook and lecture resources</h3>

      <p>
        Lecture material is available in PDF and html formats so you can download and annotate or print
        it if you'd like. If you would like a hard copy of the notes and don't have access to a printer, please
        let your instructor know (minnes@ucsd.edu).
      </p>

      <p>The <b>required</b> textbook for this course is <b>Sipser, Michael </b>
        <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation </i>.
        We highly recommend this book for the class - it's very well-written and we'll be using it extensively.

        For a physical copy, the Third Edition of this book is available through multiple vendors;
        we've seen it listed online for approximately 30 dollars.
        The library has a copy on reserves.
        I also have a number of copies of the textbook available to borrow for the term
        if you have difficulty accessing the book. Please reach out (minnes@ucsd.edu) to arrange a time to
        pick up a copy.
      </p>

      <p>To brush up on proofs, you can refer to: Richard Hammack, <i> Book of Proof, 2nd ed.</i>
        (available for download <a href="http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof" target="_blank"> here</a>).
      </p>

      <h3>Typesetting (LaTeX) Resources</h3>
      <p>All submitted homework for this class must be typed. Diagrams may be hand-drawn and
        scanned and included in the typed document. You can use a word processing editor if you
        like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.). You might
        find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. LaTeX is a markup language used
        widely in computer science and mathematics. The homework assignment prompts are typed using LaTeX
        and you can use the source files as templates for typesetting your solutions (click the "LaTeX"
        button at the top of each assignment on the <a href="assignments.html">Assignments</a> page to
        download the source files).</p>

      <p>If you have never used LaTeX, we recommend cloud resources
        that don't require you to download and install LaTeX on your local machine.
        A good example is <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Overleaf">Overleaf</a>,
        which has lots of <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn" target="_blank"
          aria-label="Overleaf documentation">documentation</a>. Overleaf works similar to Google Docs
        in that all members can edit the file in parallel and changes are updated in real time.
        There is a way to directly invite group members to your document, but the free
        version of Overleaf only allows two people to work at the same time.
        If your group has 3 people, you can turn on link sharing: Click on “Share” in the top right,
        Click “Turn on link sharing”, Copy the displayed link and share it with your group members.
        To export your work, click on the “Download PDF” button on the right-hand side.
        If you want to export the raw source files, click on the "Menu" button in the top-left,
        then click on "Source".

      <p>This <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX" target="_blank">open source LaTeX reference</a>
        can be helpful when getting started,
        and you can use the .tex source of all the files we use in class as templates.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use Google Docs, which is available through your @ucsd.edu account.
        You can create documents and then share them with your group members with manual invites
        or a shareable link. Google Docs has a LaTex add-on that lets you type formulas in
        a math typesetting environment: search for "Auto-LaTeX Equations" if you want to try this option.
        You'll need to use the display environment (start and end with $$$$) for all the
        portions you want rendered with LaTeX.
      </p>



      <h3>Software tools for state diagrams and formal models</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://flapjs.web.app/" target="_blank">flap.js</a> is a webapp under development by a group of
        UCSD students that is being piloted in CSE 105. Click the "Help" icon for a tutorial for using the app, and
        hit "Save" to download an image of the diagram you create or to get a permalink for your machine.
        flap.js is being customized for use in this class; the github repo
        is https://github.com/flapjs . You can find older versions of the app there, e.g
        https://flapjs.github.io/FLAPJS-WebApp/ ,
        if you're curious in its development.
        At the end of the quarter, you can also let me know
        if you're interested in joining the development team for flap.js to help future CSE 105 students.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.jflap.org/" target="_blank">JFLAP</a> was developed starting in the 1990s
        by a team led by Susan Rodger (RPI, then Duke). It is now a mature tool with a lot of functionality, but some
        of the conventions and notation it uses are different from the course textbook for CSE 105.
        You can follow the instructions on the JFLAP website to download and install the current stable version
        (you may need to install the Java Virtual Machine as well).
        If you use JFLAP, here are some things to keep in mind:
      <dl>
        <dt>Regular expressions</dt>
        <dd>Do not use whitespace in your regular expressions unless a
          space is a valid symbol in the alphabet. JFLAP uses a + symbol instead of the U used in the textbook
          to indicate union.</dd>
        <dt>Start and Accept States</dt>
        <dd>Don't forget to specify these when drawing your automata!</dd>
        <dt>Multiple Transitions</dt>
        <dd>If you need multiple possible inputs for the same arrow in your diagram
          (e.g. if you can move between states on either a 0 or a 1), this is done by creating separate edges in JFLAP
          for each input symbol. JFLAP will combine these into one arrow on your diagram. Automata with transitions
          labeled with a comma (e.g. "0,1") are not equivalent, because those transitions will not be followed unless
          "0,1" actually appears in your input string.</dd>
        <dt>Empty String</dt>
        <dd>In class and in the textbook, we use ε (epsilon) to denote the empty string. The instructions
          above help you change the JFLAP default λ (lambda) to match our conventions. If you need a state transition
          (or a stack symbol for PDA's) for ε, do not enter any characters into the text box for that transition and ε
          will appear.
          Entering a space does not work; that transition will be followed only if the input string has a space on it.
          Similarly, entering E or "epsilon" will not work because JFLAP will try to match those exact symbols in your
          input string for the transition.</dd>
        <dt>Push Down Automata</dt>
        <dd>Each transition has three labels: an input symbol, a stack symbol to pop,
          and a stack symbol to push. JFLAP uses the semicolon (;) instead of a right arrow to separate the stack
          symbols.
          Any of the three labels can be the empty string. Settings: Your PDAs should be "Single Character Input"
          (this option appears when you first create an automaton), and they should accept by final state, not by empty
          stack.</dd>
        <dt>Context Free Grammars</dt>
        <dd>If you have a production rule of the form "S -> A | B", enter it as two rules
          "S -> A" and "S -> B"</dd>
      </dl>
      </p>

      <a name="grades"></a>
      <h2 style="line-height: 20px;"><br><br>Grading and academic integrity<br><br><br></h2>

      <p>Grades in this class are designed to reflect your work and to document evidence of your learning this core
        material.
        Please reach out to your instructor (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you face extenuating circumstances that you think will
        impede your
        ability to participate in the planned CSE 105 activities; I'd like to work out a solution together.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two kinds of graded components for CSE 105: <b>assignments</b> and <b>tests</b>.
      <dl>
        <dt>Assignments</dt>
        <dd>
          <b>Homework</b>: open-ended, group optional homework is due (most) Tuesdays at 5pm and is associated with the
          class material from the previous week or two.
          Assignments are listed on the <a href="assignments.html" aria-label="Go to assignments page">assignments
            page</a>.
          <br><br>
          Homework
          assignments give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, while getting to
          know and learn from your classmates.
          These homework assignments may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students.
          You may switch homework partners for different homework assignments. Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s)
          are clearly visible on the first page of your homework submission and then upload the PDF to
          <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>.
          If you're working in a group, <i>submit only one submission per group</i>: one partner uploads the
          submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) to the Gradescope
          submission
          by selecting their name(s) in the "Add Group Members" dialog box. You will need to re-add your group member(s)
          every time you resubmit a new version of your assignment.
          <br><br>
          Each homework question will be graded either for
          <i>correctness</i> (including clear and precise explanations and justifications of all answers) or
          <i>fair effort completeness</i>. On the "graded for correctness"
          questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group; if your
          group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
          post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you 
          may collaborate with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public posts about these questions 
          on Piazza.
          <br><br>
          <b>Review quizzes</b>: weekly, multi-attempt quizzes on
          <a href="http://us.prairielearn.com" aria-label="Go to PrairieLearn" target="_blank">PrairieLearn</a>.
          The review quizzes can also be used to
          demonstrate your achievement with relevant concepts even after the homework is due:
          earning full credit on the quizzes relevant to a homework assignment
          will increase your grade on that assignment
          by one letter grade (if possible).
          For example, if your homework assignment earned a grade of B and have credit for the
          quiz(zes) associated with that assignment, then that assignment will be recorded as an A.
          Also, if you did not submit a homework assignment but you have credit for the
          quiz(zes) associated with that assignment, then that assignment will be recorded as a C.
          <br><br>
          <b>Project</b>: In the project you'll
          go deeper and extend your work to explore an application of your
          choosing. The project is an individual assignment, and is listed on the
          <a href="assignments.html" aria-label="Go to assignments page">assignments page</a>.
          It will serve as the take-home final for the class and is due on Gradescope
          during the published final exam time.
          <br><br>
          The late submission deadline for assignments is there as a buffer if you have technical issues
          or extenuating circumstances at the deadline. There are no submissions after the late submission deadline.
          I recommend starting homework assignments well before the deadline and submitting early drafts so
          that last minute extenuating circumstances do not have as big an impact.
          If there are extenuating
          circumstances that prevent you from submitting a homework please use this form to let us know:
          <a href="https://forms.gle/ju7tcSZXSjSvfe9x5" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/ju7tcSZXSjSvfe9x5</a> .
          Completing this form does not mean that we will be able to accept a late submission of the assignment.
          However, it can help us work with you to support your work in this class.<br>
        </dd>
        <dt>Tests</dt>
        <dd>
          There are two 45-minute <b>tests</b> in the course, and you can sign up for
          up to two attempts at each. You must self-schedule the tests to be
          taken in-person at the Computer Based Testing Facility (CBTF).
          <br><br>
          <b>Test 1</b>: Attempt 1 available 11/4/2024 - 11/6/2024, Attempt 2
          available 12/2/2024 - 12/6/2024.
          <br><br>
          <b>Test 2</b>: Attempt 1 available 11/25/2024 - 11/27/2024, Attempt 2
          available 12/2/2024 - 12/6/2024.

          Having two attempts for each test helps the tests serve as learning opportunities
          so that you can study any mistakes you make and re-apply that knowledge on the second attempt.
          You do not need to take both attempts for each test. At the end of the quarter, 
          for each test we will record your highest attempt grade.
          <br><br>
          Tests for this course will be administered by the Triton Testing Center (TTC) in
          the Computer-Based Testing Lab in AP&M B349. The TTC's rules concerning
          testing are the rules for this course.
          <br><br>
          You must schedule your tests in advance, and it is recommended that you do so as
          soon as possible. Scheduling for all tests opens on the first day of instruction. To
          schedule, visit prairietest.com and log in with your UC San Diego credentials (after selecting
          "Sign in with Google").
          <br><br>
          More information about testing policies and procedures can be found on the
          TTC's website. You may also email tritontesting@ucsd.edu for assistance.
          <br><br>
          Please note that, if you plan to use OSD-approved accommodations for your test,
          you will take it at the TTC's Pepper Canyon Hall location. You must schedule
          your test at least three days in advance through the RegisterBlast system.
          <br><br>
          There are no make-up tests for the tests during the quarter.

      </dl>
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the quarter, grades will be assigned according to the following standards: </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>A</dt>
        <dd>A on one test and B or above on the other test</dd>
        <dd><b>And</b>:<br>
          A on at least 4 homeworks, B or above on at least one homework, any grade on remaining homework</dd>
        <dd><b>And</b>:<br>
          Passing grade on the project. Modifiers: A+ for exceptional projects; A- if the grade on the project is B or
          lower.

        </dd>
        <dt>B</dt>
        <dd>B or higher on both tests <b>or</b> A on one of the tests and C on the other</dd>
        <dd><b>And</b>:<br>
          B or above on at least 4 homeworks, C or above on at least one homework, any grade on remaining homework</dd>

        <dd><b>And</b>:<br>
          Passing grade on the project. Modifiers: B+ if the grade on the project is A; B- if the grade on the project
          is C or lower.

        </dd>
        <dt>C</dt>
        <dd>C or higher on both tests</dd>
        <dd><b>And</b>:<br>
          C or above on at least 3 among the homeworks and the project, any grade on rest of assignments.
          Note: you do not need to pass the project to pass the class if you earn passing grades on at least three
          assignments (after review quiz credit is factored in). Modifiers: C+ if the grade on the project is B or
          higher; C- if the grade on the project is not passing.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The assigned letter grade will be the highest grade for which the standards are met.
        The project is also used to add +/- modifiers at the end of the quarter.
        We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient, but we guarantee that we will not adjust the scale to make it
        harder to get a better grade.

      <p>The UC San Diego Academic Integrity pledge is
        <a href="https://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu/forms/form-pledge.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
        Academic integrity violations will be taken seriously and reported to the campus-wide Academic Integrity Office.
        Key facts about academic integrity related to CSE 105:
      <dl>
        <dd>&check; Use only resources explicitly allowed for each assignment. Resources not affiliated with this
          quarter's
          version of the class may use inconsistent notation or definitions. If you need help, please reach out to the
          instructor, TAs, and tutors.</dd>
        <dd>&check; Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with other students in the class
          who are not
          in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning experience and detract from their success in the class.
        </dd>
        <dd>&check; Before and during taking any individual assessment, do not attempt to obtain information about the
          contents of
          the test from students who have already taken it or from any nonauthorized source.</dd>
        <dd>&check; You may not ask for help from anyone while taking individual assessments since they are intended to
          reflect
          <i>your own</i> mastery of the material. In particular, you may not collaborate on exam questions with other
          students in the class and you may not post any portion of the exam on forums where others may assist you.
        </dd>
        <dd>&check; After taking an exam or test, do not discuss its contents with anyone in the class
          who has not yet taken it. Do not post information about it or share information about it with others who
          haven't
          taken it.</dd>
      </dl>

        Sometimes, circumstances beyond a student's control prevent them from completing a class
        even once they have completed the majority of the coursework at a passing level.
        UCSD has a process in place for you to request an Incomplete (I) if this happens to you.
        Here is the campus policy about the Incomplete grade:
        <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Regulations/500"
          target="

      <h2>Policies</h2>

      <h3>Late Adds</h3>
      <p>I follow the CSE department guidance on Late Adds, namely that
        "all students are expected to attend class for the first two weeks and complete assignments
        if they are on the waitlist for a course. Attending class and completing course assignments does
        not guarantee enrollment. If students choose to miss class or not turn in assignments while on the waitlist,
        the student will receive a "0" on all missed assignments, if they secure a seat in the course off the waitlist."
      </p>

      <h3>Regrades</h3>
      <p>The window for requesting regrades once assignment feedback has been published will
        be set in <a href="http://gradescope.com" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to Gradescope">Gradescope</a>
        and will typically be 2-3 days.
        If you submit a regrade request, please include a brief but detailed explanation of why you
        think there was an error in the grading. A regrade request may lead to us reviewing the entire
        assignment and may lead to the score
        being adjusted up or down depending on any errors found in the original grading. All regrades will
        be considered once the regrade window closes; thank you in advance for your patience while we
        carefully look through them.</p>

      <h3>Computer Based Testing Facility (CBTF)</h3>
