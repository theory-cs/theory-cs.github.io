{\bf Review}: Formal definition of DFA: $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ 

\begin{center}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}

In the state diagram of $M$, how many outgoing arrows are there from each state?

$M = ( \{ q, r, s\}, \{a,b\}, \delta, q, \{s\} )$ 
where $\delta$ is  (rows labelled by states
and columns labelled by symbols):

$q$ & $r$ & $q$ \\
$r$ & $r$ & $s$ \\

Give two examples of strings that are accepted by $M$ and two examples of strings that are rejected by $M$:

Add ``labels" for states in the state diagram, e.g. ``have not seen any of desired pattern yet'' or
``sink state''.

We can use the analysis of the roles of the states in the state diagram to describe the language
recognized by the DFA.

{\bf Note}: On Wednesday, we'll see a new kind of finite automaton. It will be helpful to distinguish it from the
machines we've been talking about so we'll use {\bf Deterministic Finite Automaton} (DFA) to refer to the machines

{\bf Warmup}: Design a DFA (deterministic finite automaton) and an NFA (nondeterministic
finite automaton) that each recognize each of the following languages over $\{a,b\}$
\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ and ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill

\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ or ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill



\textbf{Strategy}: To design DFA or NFA for a given language,  
identify patterns that can be built up as we process strings and create states
for intermediate stages. Or: decompose the language to a simpler one 
that we already know how to recognize with a DFA or NFA.


{\it Recall} (from Wednesday of last week, and in textbook Exercise 1.14): 
if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.


Let's practice defining automata constructions by coming up with other ways to get new automata from old.
\newpage

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Use nondeterminism to choose which of $N_1$, $N_2$ to run.

\vfill
\begin{comment}
    Draw schematic
\end{comment}

{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$
and assume $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$ and that $q_0 \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2$.
Construct $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q = $
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is defined by, for $q \in Q$ and $x \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:
        \[
            \phantom{\delta((q,x))=\begin{cases}  \delta_1 ((q,x)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_1 \\ \delta_2 ((q,x)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_2 \\ \{q1,q2\} &\qquad\text{if } q = q_0, x = \varepsilon \\ \emptyset\text{if } q= q_0, x \neq \varepsilon \end{cases}}
        \]
\end{itemize}


\vfill
{\it Proof of correctness would prove that $L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$ by considering
an arbitrary string accepted by $N$, tracing an accepting computation of $N$ on it, and using 
that trace to prove the string is in at least one of $A_1$, $A_2$; then, taking an arbitrary 
string in $A_1 \cup A_2$ and proving that it is accepted by $N$. Details left for extra practice.}

Could we do the same construction with DFA?

Happily, though, an analogous claim is true!

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M_1$ such that $L(M_1) = A_1$ and

**This definition was in the pre-class reading**
{\bf Definition 1.52}: A {\bf regular expression} over alphabet $\Sigma$
is a syntactic expression that can describe a language over $\Sigma$. The collection of all regular
expressions over $\Sigma$ is defined recursively:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}    
    $a$ is a regular expression, for $a \in \Sigma$

    $\varepsilon$ is a regular expression

    $\emptyset$ is a regular expression
\end{quote}

\item[] {\it Recursive steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}
    $(R_1 \cup R_2)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions 

    $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions

    $(R_1^*)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$ is a regular expression 
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
 

The {\it semantics} (or meaning) of the syntactic regular expression is the {\bf language
described by the regular expression}. The function that assigns a language to a regular expression
over $\Sigma$ is defined recursively, using familiar set operations:


\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
    \begin{quote}    
        The language described by $a$, for $a \in \Sigma$, is $\{a\}$ and we write 
        $L(a) = \{a\}$
    
        The language described by $\varepsilon$ is $\{\varepsilon\}$ and we write 
        $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon\}$
    
        The language described by $\emptyset$ is $\{\}$ and we write
        $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
    \end{quote}
    
    \item[] {\it Recursive steps of recursive definition}
    \begin{quote}
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \cup R_2)$ is the union of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \cup R_2)~) = L(R_1) \cup L(R_2) = \{ w \mid w \in L(R_1) \lor w \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is the concatenation of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \circ R_2)~) = L(R_1) \circ L(R_2) = \{ uv \mid u \in L(R_1) \land v \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$ is a regular expression, the language described by the regular 
        expression $(R_1^*)$ is the {\bf Kleene star} of the language described by $R_1$ and we write
        $$L(~(R_1^*)~) = (~L(R_1)~)^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L(R_1)\}$$
    \end{quote}
\end{itemize}
  
\newpage
For the following examples assume the alphabet is $\Sigma_1 =  \{0,1\}$:
    
The language described by the regular expression $0$ is $L(0) = \{ 0 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $1$ is $L(1)  = \{ 1 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\varepsilon$ is $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon  \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\emptyset$ is $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$

The language described by the regular expression $(\Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1)^*$ 
is $L(~(\Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1)^*~) = $

{\bf Caution: many programming languages that support regular expressions build in functionality
that is more powerful than the ``pure'' definition of regular expressions given here. }

Regular expressions are everywhere (once you start looking for them).

Software tools and languages often have built-in support for regular expressions to describe
{\bf patterns} that we want to match (e.g. Excel/ Sheets, grep, Perl, python, Java, Ruby).

Under the hood, the first phase of {\bf compilers} is to transform the strings we write 
in code to tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers, literals). Compilers use regular expressions
to describe the sets of strings that can be used for each token type.

Next time: we'll start to see how to build machines that decide whether strings match the pattern
described by a regular expression.

\newpage

Practice with the regular expressions over $\{a,b\}$ below.

For example: Which regular expression(s) below describe a language that includes the string $a$ as an element?

$a^* b^*$ 

\vfill

$a(ba)^* b$

\vfill

$a^* \cup b^*$

\vfill

$(aaa)^*$

\vfill

$(\varepsilon \cup a) b$

**This definition was in the pre-class reading**
A finite automaton (FA) is specified by  $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.
This $5$-tuple is called the {\bf formal definition} of the FA. The FA can also 
be represented by its state diagram: with nodes for the state, labelled edges specifying the 
transition function, and decorations on nodes denoting the start and accept states.

\begin{quote}
Finite set of states $Q$ can be labelled by any collection of distinct names. Often
we use default state labels $q0, q1, \ldots$ 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}  
The alphabet $\Sigma$ determines the possible inputs to the automaton. 
Each input to the automaton is a string over  $\Sigma$, and the automaton ``processes'' the input
one symbol (or character) at a time.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The transition function $\delta$ gives the next state of the automaton based on the current state of 
the machine and on the next input symbol.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The start state $q_0$ is an element of $Q$.  Each computation of the machine starts at the  start  state.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The accept (final) states $F$ form a subset of the states of the automaton, $F \subseteq  Q$. 
These states are used to flag if the machine accepts or rejects an input string.
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
The computation of a machine on an input string is a sequence of states
in the machine,  starting with the start state, determined by transitions 
of the machine as it reads successive input symbols.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The finite automaton $M$ accepts the given input string exactly when the computation of $M$ on the input string
ends in an accept state. $M$ rejects the given input string exactly when the computation of 
$M$ on the input string ends in a nonaccept state, that is, a state that is not in $F$.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote} 
The language of $M$, $L(M)$, is defined as the set of  all strings that are each accepted 
by the machine $M$. Each string that is rejected by $M$ is not in $L(M)$.
The language of $M$ is also called the language recognized by $M$.
\end{quote}   
   
What is {\bf finite} about all finite automata? (Select all that apply)
\begin{itemize}
   \item[$\square$] The size of the machine (number of states, number of arrows)
   \item[$\square$] The length of each computation of the machine
   \item[$\square$] The number of strings that are accepted by the machine
\end{itemize}

Classify each string $a, aa, ab, ba, bb, \varepsilon$ as accepted by the FA or rejected by the FA.  

{\it Why are these the only two options?}
