{\bf Definition}: When $A$ and $B$ are sets, we say any subset of $A \times B$ is a {\bf binary relation}. 
A relation $R$ can also be represented as

\begin{itemize}
\item A function $f_{TF} : A \times B \to \{T, F\}$
where, for $a \in A$ and $b \in B$, $f_{TF}(~(a,b)~) = 
\begin{cases} 
    T \qquad&\text{when } (a,b) \in R \\
    F \qquad&\text{when } (a,b) \notin R
\end{cases}$
\item A function $f_{\mathcal{P}} : A   \to \mathcal{P}(B)$ where, for $a \in A$, 
$f_{\mathcal{P}}( a ) = \{ b \in B ~|~ (a,b) \in R \}$
\end{itemize}

When $A$ is a set, we say any subset of $A \times A$ is a (binary) {\bf relation} on $A$.

 \vfill
\section*{Relations as graphs}


For relation $R$ on a set $A$, we can represent this relation as a
{\bf graph}: a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (arrows). The 
nodes of the graph are the elements of $A$ and 
there is an edge from $a$ to $b$ exactly when $(a,b) \in R$.

\vspace{100pt} \vfill
\section*{Binary relation examples}


{\it Example}: For $A = \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})$, we can define the relation $EQ_{\mathbb{R}}$ on $A$ as 
\[
\{ (X_1, X_2 ) \in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})  \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}) ~|~ |X_1| = |X_2| \}
\]

\vspace{50pt}

{\it Example}: Let $R_{(\textbf{mod } n)}$ be the set of all pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that $(a \textbf{ mod } n = b \textbf{ mod } n)$.
Then $a$ is {\bf congruent to} $b$ \textbf{mod} $n$ means $(a, b) \in R_{(\textbf{mod } n)}$. A common notation is to write this as $a \equiv b (\textbf{mod } n)$.


$R_{(\textbf{mod } n)}$ is a relation on the set $\underline{\phantom{\mathbb{Z}}\hspace{20em}}$


Some example elements of $R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}$ are: 

\vspace{50pt} \vfill
\section*{Reflexive relation definition}


A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called {\bf reflexive} 
means $(a, a) \in R$ for every element $a \in A$. 
 \vfill
\section*{Reflexive relation informally}


{\it Informally}, every element is related to itself.

{\it Graphically}, there are self-loops (edge from a node back to itself) at 
every node. \vfill
\section*{Symmetric relation definition}


A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called {\bf symmetric} means 
$(b, a) \in R$ whenever $(a, b) \in R$, for all $a, b \in A$. 
 \vfill
\section*{Symmetric relation informally}


{\it Informally}, order doesn't matter for this relation.

{\it Graphically}, every edge has a paired ``backwards'' edge so we might
as well drop the arrows and think of edges as undirected. \vfill
\section*{Transitive relation definition}


A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called {\bf transitive} means 
whenever $(a, b) \in R$ and $(b, c) \in R$, then $(a, c) \in R$, for all $a, b, c \in A$.
 \vfill
\section*{Transitive relation informally}


{\it Informally}, chains of relations collapse.

{\it Graphically}, there's a shortcut between any endpoints of a chain of 
edges. \vfill
\section*{Antisymmetric relation definition}


A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called {\bf antisymmetric} means 
$\forall a \in A ~\forall b \in A~\left(~\left( ~(a,b) \in R \land (b,a) \in R ~\right) \to a=b~\right)$
 \vfill
\section*{Antisymmetric relation informally}


{\it Informally}, the relation has directionality.

{\it Graphically}, can organize the nodes of the graph so that 
all non-self loop edges go up. \vfill
\section*{Binary relation properties examples}



When the domain is $\{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\}$ define a relation that is {\bf not reflexive} and 
is {\bf not symmetric} and is {\bf not transitive}.

\vspace{80pt}

When the domain is $\{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\}$ define a relation that is {\bf not reflexive} but 
is {\bf symmetric} and is {\bf transitive}.

\vspace{80pt}


When the domain is $\{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\}$ define a relation that is {\bf symmetric} and
is {\bf antisymmetric}.

\vspace{80pt}

Is the relation $EQ_{\mathbb{R}}$ reflexive? symmetric? transitive? antisymmetric?

\vspace{80pt}

Is the relation $R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}$ reflexive? symmetric? transitive? antisymmetric?

\vspace{80pt}

Is the relation $Sub$ on $W = \mathcal{P}(\{1,2,3,4,5\})$ given by $Sub = \{ (X,Y) \mid X \subseteq Y \}$
reflexive? symmetric? transitive? antisymmetric?

\vspace{80pt}
 \vfill
\section*{Equivalence relation definition}


A relation is an {\bf equivalence relation} means it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. \vfill
\section*{Partial order definition}


A relation is a {\bf partial ordering} (or partial order) means 
it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. \vfill
\section*{Hasse diagram definition}


For a partial ordering, its {\bf Hasse diagram} is a graph whose nodes (vertices) are the elements of the 
domain of the binary relation and which are located such that nodes connected to nodes
above them by (undirected) edges indicate that the relation holds between the lower node and the higher node. 
Moreover, the diagram omits self-loops and omits edges that are guaranteed by transitivity.
 \vfill
\section*{Hasse diagram example}


Draw the Hasse diagram of the partial order on the set $\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$ defined as
\begin{align*}
    \{  &(a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (d,d), (e,e), (f,f), (g,g), \\
        &(a,c), (a,d), (d,g), (a,g), (b,f), (b,e), (e,g), (b,g) \}
\end{align*}

\section*{Partition definition}


A {\bf partition} of a set $A$ is a set of non-empty, disjoint subsets 
$A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n$ such that 
\[
    A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \{ x \mid \exists i (x \in A_i) \}
\] \vfill
\section*{Equivalence class definition}


An {\bf equivalence class} of an element $a \in A$ 
with respect to an equivalence relation $R$ on the set $A$ is the set 
\[
    \{s \in A \mid (a, s) \in R \}
\] 
We write $[a]_R$ for this set, which is the equivalence class of $a$ with respect to $R$. \vfill
\section*{Congruence classes mod four}


{\it Recall}: We say $a$ is {\bf congruent to} $b$ \textbf{mod} $n$ 
means $(a, b) \in R_{(\textbf{mod } n)}$. 
A common notation is to write this as $a \equiv b (\textbf{mod } n)$.

We can partition the set of integers using equivalence classes of  $R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}$

\begin{align*}
    [0]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv 0 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = 0 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 0 \} = \{ 4c \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }\\
    [1]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv 1 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = 1 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 1 \} = \{ 4c+1 \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }\\
    [2]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv 2 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = 2 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 0 \} = \{ 4c+2 \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }\\
    [3]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv 3 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = 3 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 3 \} = \{ 4c+3 \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }\\
    [4]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv 4 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = 4 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 0 \} = \{ 4c \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }\\
    [5]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv 5 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = 5 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 1 \} = \{ 4c+1 \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }\\
    [-1]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} &= \phantom{ \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \equiv -1 ((\textbf{mod } 4)) \} 
    = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x \textbf{ mod } 4 = -1 \textbf{ mod } 4 = 3 \} = \{ 4c+3 \mid c \in \mathbb{Z}\} }
\end{align*}
\[
\mathbb{Z} =  [0]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}}~ \cup ~[1]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}} ~\cup~[2]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}}~\cup~
[3]_{R_{(\textbf{mod } 4)}}

\section*{Modular arithmetic motivation}


Integers are useful because they can be used to encode other objects
and have multiple representations. However, infinite sets are sometimes
expensive to work with computationally. Reducing our attention to 
a {\it partition of the integers} based on congrunce mod $n$, where
each part is represented by a (not too large) integer gives a useful 
compromise where many algebraic properties of the integers are preserved, 
and we also get the benefits of a finite domain. Moreover, modular arithmetic
is well-suited to model any cyclic behavior. \vfill
\section*{Congruence mod n lemma}


{\bf Lemma}: For $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
and positive integer $n$, $(a,b) \in R_{(\textbf{mod } n)}$ if and only if  $n | a-b$.

{\bf Proof}: 

\phantom{Consider arbitrary integers $a,b$ and arbitrary positive integer $n$.}

\phantom{Assume $a \textbf{ mod } n = b \textbf{ mod } n$. Call this 
remainder $r$ and we have integers $q_1, q_2$ such that $a = q_1 n + r$
and $b = q_2 n + r$. Calculating $a-b = (q_1 n + r) - (q_2n +r) = (q_1 - q_2)n$ 
an integer multiple of $n$, as required.}

\phantom{Assume there is integer $c$ with $a-b = cn$. By long division 
there are integers $q$ and $r$ ($0 \leq r < n$) with $b = qn + r$. Then 
$a = b + cn = qn+r + cn = (q+c)n + r$. Since long division gives a unique remainder,
this means $a \textbf{ mod } n = r = b \textbf{ mod } n$, as required.}

{\bf Key idea for cardinality}: Counting

\section*{Well defined functions}


Recall that a function is defined by its (1) domain, (2) codomain, and (3) rule assigning each 
element in the domain exactly one element in the codomain. 
The domain and codomain are nonempty sets.
The rule can be depicted as a table, formula, English description, etc.

A function can {\it fail to be well-defined} if there is some 
domain element where the function rule doesn't give a
unique codomain element. For example, the function rule might lead to 
more than one potential image, or to an image outside of the codomain.


{\it Example}: $f_A: \mathbb{R}^+ \to \mathbb{Q}$ with $f_A(x) = x$ is {\bf not} a well-defined function because

the function $g: C  \to  D$  such that $g(b) = a$ iff  $f(a) =  b$.

\section*{Cardinality caution}


{\it Caution}: we use 
familiar symbols to define cardinality, like
$| \phantom{\cdots} | \leq | \phantom{\cdots} |$
and 
$| \phantom{\cdots} | \geq | \phantom{\cdots} |$
and 
$| \phantom{\cdots} | = | \phantom{\cdots} |$, 
but the meaning of these symbols depends on context.
We've seen that vertical lines can mean absolute
value (for real numbers), divisibility (for integers), 
and now sizes (for sets). 

Now we see that $\leq$ and $\geq$ can mean comparing
numbers or comparing sizes of sets. When the sets being 
compared are finite, the definitions 
of $|A| \leq |B|$ agree. 

But, properties of numbers cannot be assumed when comparing
cardinalities of infinite sets.

In a nutshell: cardinality of sets is defined via functions.
This definition agrees with the usual notion of ``size'' for 
finite sets. \vfill

\newpage
{\bf Claim}: There is an uncountable set.  Example: $\underline{\phantom{~~~\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})~~~}}$

{\bf Proof}:  By definition of countable, since $\underline{\phantom{~~~\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})~~~}}$
is not finite, {\bf to show} is $|\mathbb{N}| \neq  |\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})|$ .

Rewriting using  the definition of  cardinality, {\bf to show} is

\phantom{$\neg \exists f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})  ~~(f \text{ is a bijection})~~$}

\phantom{or equivalently $\forall f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})  ~~(f \text{ is not a bijection})~~$}


Towards a proof by  universal generalization,  consider  an arbitrary function $f:  \mathbb{N} \to\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

{\bf To show}: $f$ is not a bijection.  It's enough to show that $f$ is not onto.

Rewriting using the definition of  onto, {\bf to show}:
\[
\neg  \forall  B \in  \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) ~\exists a \in \mathbb{N}  ~(~f(a) =  B~)
\]
. By logical  equivalence, we can write this as an existential statement:
\[
\underline{\phantom{\qquad\qquad\exists B \in  \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}) ~\forall a \in \mathbb{N}  ~(~f(a) \neq  B~)\qquad\qquad}}
\]
In search of a witness, define the following  collection of nonnegative integers:
\[
D_f = \{ n \in \mathbb{N}  ~\mid~  n \notin f(n)  \}
\]
. By  definition  of power  set, since  all elements  of  $D_f$ are  in  $\mathbb{N}$,   $D_f \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.  It's enough to prove the following Lemma: 

{\bf Lemma}: $\forall a \in \mathbb{N}  ~(~f(a) \neq  D_f~)$.


{\bf Proof  of lemma}: \phantom{Towards universal  generalization, consider an arbitrary  $a \in \mathbb{N}$.
By definition  of set equality, {\bf to show} is  $\exists  x ( \neg  (x \in f(a)~  \leftrightarrow  ~x \in D_f))$.
For a witness, consider $x = a$.  There are two cases:  $a \in  f(a)~\vee~a \notin f(a)$. By definition 
of $D_f$, each guarantees that $f(a) \neq  D_f$.}\\

\vspace{50pt}

By  the Lemma, we  have proved that $f$ is not onto, and since $f$ was arbitrary, there are no onto
functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$. QED

{\bf Claim}: $\{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}$ is uncountable.

{\it Approach 1}: Mimic proof that $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{Z}^+)$ is uncountable.


{\bf Proof}:  By definition of countable, since $\{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}$
is not finite, {\bf to show} is $|\mathbb{N}| \neq  |\{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}|$ .


{\bf To show} is
$\forall f : \mathbb{Z}^+ \to \{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}  ~~(f \text{ is not a bijection})~~$.
Towards a proof by  universal generalization, consider  an arbitrary function 
$f:  \mathbb{Z}^+ \to \{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}$.
{\bf To show}: $f$ is not a bijection.  It's enough to show that $f$ is not onto.
Rewriting using the definition of  onto, {\bf to show}:
\[
\exists x \in \{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \} ~\forall a \in \mathbb{N}  ~(~f(a) \neq  x~)
\]
In search of a witness, define the following  real number by defining its binary expansion
\[
d_f = 0.b_1 b_2 b_3 \cdots
\]
where $b_i = 1-b_{ii}$ where $b_{jk}$ is the coefficient of $2^{-k}$ in the binary expansion of $f(j)$.
Since\footnote{There's a subtle imprecision in this part of the proof as presented, but it can be fixed.} $d_f \neq f(a)$ for any positive integer $a$, $f$ is not onto.


{\it Approach 2}: Nested closed interval property

{\bf To show} $f: \mathbb{N} \to \{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0  \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}$ is not onto. 
{\bf  Strategy}: Build
a sequence of nested closed intervals that each avoid some $f(n)$.   Then  the real
number that is in all of the intervals  can't be $f(n)$ for any $n$. Hence,  $f$ is not  onto.

Consider the function $f: \mathbb{N} \to \{  r \in \mathbb{R} ~\mid~ 0 \leq r ~\wedge~ r \leq 1 \}$ with  $f(n) = \frac{1+\sin(n)}{2}$

\section*{Algorithm redundancy}


Real-life representations are often prone to corruption.  Biological codes, like RNA, 
may mutate naturally\footnote{Mutations of specific RNA codons have been linked to many disorders and cancers.}
and during measurement; cosmic radiation and other ambient noise 
can flip bits in computer storage\footnote{This RadioLab podcast episode
goes into more detail on bit flips: \url{https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bit-flip}}. 
One way to recover from corrupted data is to introduce or exploit redundancy. 

Consider the following algorithm to introduce redundancy in a string of $0$s and $1$s.
\begin{algorithm}[caption={Create redundancy by repeating each bit three times}]
procedure $\textit{redun3}$($a_{k-1} \cdots a_0$: a nonempty bitstring)
for $i$ := $0$ to $k-1$
  $c_{3i}$ := $a_i$
  $c_{3i+1}$ := $a_i$
  $c_{3i+2}$ := $a_i$
return $c_{3k-1} \cdots c_0$
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[caption={Decode sequence of bits using majority rule on consecutive three bit sequences}]
procedure $\textit{decode3}$($c_{3k-1} \cdots c_0$: a nonempty bitstring whose length is an integer multiple of $3$)
for $i$ := $0$ to $k-1$
  if exactly two or three of $c_{3i}, c_{3i+1}, c_{3i+2}$ are set to $1$
    $a_i$ := 1
  else 
    $a_i$ := 0
return $a_{k-1} \cdots a_0$
\end{algorithm}

Give a recursive definition of the set of outputs of the $redun3$ procedure, $Out$,

\phantom{{\bf Basis step}: $000 \in Out$ and $111 \in Out$\\ {\bf Recursive step}: If $x \in Out$ then $x000 \in Out$ and $x111 \in Out$ (where $x000$ and $x111$ are the results of string concatenation).}


Consider the message $m = 0001$ so that the sender calculates $redun3(m) = redun3(0001) = 000000000111$.

Introduce $\underline{\phantom{~~4~~}} $
errors into the message so that the signal received by the 
receiver is $\underline{\phantom{010100010101}}$
but the receiver is still able to decode the original message.


{\it Challenge: what is the biggest number of errors you can introduce?} 

Building a circuit for lines 3-6 in $decode$ procedure: given three input bits, we need to determine whether the
majority is a $0$ or a $1$.

\section*{Predicate definition}


{\bf  Definition}: A  {\bf predicate}  is  a function from a given set (domain) to $\{T,F\}$.

A predicate can be applied, or {\bf evaluated} at, an element of the domain.

Usually, a predicate {\it describes a  property} that domain elements may or may not have.

Two predicates over the same domain are {\bf equivalent} means they evaluate to
the same truth values for all possible assignments of domain elements to the
input. In other words, they are equivalent means that they are equal as functions.

To define a predicate, we must specify its domain and its value at each domain element.
The rule assigning truth values to domain elements can be specified using a formula, 
English description, in a table (if the domain is finite), or recursively (if the domain is recursively
defined). \vfill

    Fill in the table of values for the predicate $N(x)$ based on the formula given. \vfill
\section*{Predicate truth set definition}


{\bf Definition}: The {\bf truth  set} of a  predicate is the collection of all elements in its
domain where the predicate evaluates to $T$.

Notice that specifying the domain and the truth set is sufficient for defining
a predicate. \vfill
\section*{Predicate truth set example}


The truth set for the predicate $V(x)$ is $\underline{\phantom{\{ x ~\mid~ V(x) = T\} = \{ 001, 010, 011 \}}}$.

The truth set for the predicate $N(x)$ is $\underline{\phantom{\{ x ~\mid~ N(x) = T\} = \{ 101, 111 \}}}$.

The truth set for the predicate $Mystery(x)$ is $\underline{\phantom{\{ x ~\mid~ Mystery(x) = T\} = \{ 000, 001, 010, 101, 111 \}}}$.


\vfill \vfill
\section*{Quantification definition}


The {\bf universal quantification} of predicate $P(x)$ over
domain $U$ is the statement ``$P(x)$ for all values of $x$ in the domain $U$''
and is written $\forall x P(x)$ or $\forall x \in U ~P(x)$. 
When the domain is finite, universal quantification over the domain 
is equivalent to iterated {\it conjunction} (ands).

The {\bf existential quantification} of predicate $P(x)$ 
over domain $U$ is the statement ``There exists an element $x$ 
in the domain $U$ such that $P(x)$'' and is written $\exists x P(x)$
for $\exists x \in U ~P(x)$. 
When the domain is finite, existential quantification over the domain 
is equivalent to iterated {\it disjunction} (ors).

An element for which $P(x) = F$ is called a {\bf counterexample} of $\forall x P(x)$.

An element for which $P(x) = T$ is called a {\bf witness} of $\exists x P(x)$.
 \vfill
\section*{Quantification logical equivalence}


Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are {\bf logically equivalent} 
means they have the same truth value no matter which predicates (domains and functions) 
are substituted in. 

{\bf Quantifier version of De Morgan's laws}: 
$\boxed{\neg \forall x P(x) ~\equiv~ \exists x \left( \neg P(x) \right)}$
\qquad
\qquad
$\boxed{\neg \exists x Q(x) ~\equiv~ \forall x \left( \neg Q(x) \right)}$
 \vfill
\section*{Quantification examples finite domain}


Examples of quantifications using $V(x), N(x), Mystery(x)$:

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\exists x~ (~V(x) \land N(x)~)$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\forall x~ (~V(x) \to N(x)~)$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\exists x~ (~N(x) \leftrightarrow Mystery(x)~)$

Rewrite $\lnot \forall x~(~V(x) \oplus Mystery(x)~)$ into a logical equivalent statement.

\vspace{50pt}


Notice that these are examples where the predicates have {\it finite} domain.
How would we evaluate quantifications where the domain may be infinite? \vfill

{\it Recall the definitions}: The set of RNA strands $S$ is defined (recursively) by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}

{\bf Claim} $\forall s \in S ~(~rnalen(s) > 0~)$

{\bf Proof}: Let $s$ be an arbitrary RNA strand. By the recursive definition of $S$,
either $s \in B$ or there is some strand $s_0$ and some base $b$ such that $s = s_0 b$.
We will show that the inequality holds for both cases.

{$\phantom{Basis}$} {\bf Case}: Assume $s \in B$. We need to show $rnalen(s) > 0$. 
By the basis step in the definition of $rnalen$,
$$rnalen(s) = 1$$
which is greater than $0$, as required.

{$\phantom{Recursive}$} {\bf Case}: Assume there is some strand $s_0$ and some base $b$ 
such that $s = s_0 b$. We will show {\it (the stronger claim)} that 
\[
    \forall u \in S ~\forall b \in B ~( ~\textit{rnalen}(u) >0  \to

Consider an arbitrary RNA strand $u$ and an arbitrary base $b$, and assume towards a

\section*{Structural induction example rnalen basecount}


{\bf Claim} $\forall s \in S \, (\textit{rnalen(s)} \geq \textit{basecount}(~(s, \A)~))$:

{\bf Proof}: We proceed by structural induction on the recursively defined set $S$.

{\bf Basis  Case}: We need to prove that 
the inequality holds for each element in the basis step of the recursive
definition of $S$. 
Need to show 
\begin{align*}
          &(~ rnalen(\A) \geq basecount(~(\A, \A)~)~) \land (~ rnalen(\C) \geq basecount(~(\C, \A)~)~) \\
    \land & (~ rnalen(\U) \geq basecount(~(\U, \A)~)~) \land (~ rnalen(\G) \geq basecount(~(\G, \A)~)~)
\end{align*}
We calculate, using the definitions of $rnalen$ and $basecount$:

\vspace{100pt}

{\bf Recursive Case}: We will prove that 
\[
    \forall u \in S ~\forall b \in B ~( ~rnalen(u) \geq basecount(~(u, \A)~) \to 
    rnalen(ub) \geq basecount(~(ub, \A)~)
\]

Consider arbitrary RNA strand $u$ and arbitrary base $b$. Assume, as the {\bf induction hypothesis},
that $rnalen(u) \geq basecount(~(u,\A)~)$. We need to show that $rnalen(ub) \geq basecount(~(ub, \A)~)$.

Using the recursive step in the definition of the function $rnalen$:
\[
    rnalen(ub) = 1 + rnalen(u)
\]
The recursive step in the definition of the function $basecount$ has two cases. We notice that 
$b = \A \lor b \neq \A$ and we proceed by cases.

{\it Case i.} Assume $b = \A$.

Using the first case in the recursive step in the definition of the function $basecount$:
\[
    basecount(~(ub, \A)~) = 1 + basecount(~(u,\A)~)
\]
By the {\bf induction hypothesis}, we know that $basecount(~(u,\A)~) \leq rnalen(u)$ so:
\[
    basecount(~(ub, \A)~) = 1 + basecount(~(u,\A)~) \leq 1 + rnalen(u) = rnalen (ub)
\]
and, thus, $basecount(~(ub,\A)~) \leq rnalen(ub)$, as required.

{\it Case ii.} Assume $b \neq \A$. 

Using the second case in the recursive step in the definition of the function $basecount$:
\[
    basecount(~(ub, \A)~) = basecount(~(u,\A)~)
\]
By the {\bf induction hypothesis}, we know that $basecount(~(u,\A)~) \leq rnalen(u)$ so:
\[
    basecount(~(ub, \A)~) = basecount(~(u,\A)~) \leq rnalen(u) < 1 + rnalen(u) = rnalen (ub)
\]
and, thus, $basecount(~(ub,\A)~) \leq rnalen(ub)$, as required.

We use some terminology to describe different roles statements can have.

{\bf Theorem}: Statement that can be shown to be true, usually an important one.

Less important theorems can be called {\bf proposition}, {\bf fact}, {\bf result}, {\bf claim}.

{\bf Lemma}: A less important theorem that is useful in proving a theorem.
 
{\bf Corollary}: A theorem that can be proved directly after another one has been proved, 
without needing a lot of extra work.

{\bf Invariant}: A theorem that describes a property that is true about an algorithm or 
system no matter what inputs are used.

{\bf Theorem}: A robot on an infinite 2-dimensional integer grid starts at $(0,0)$ and at each step moves
to diagonally adjacent grid point. This robot can / cannot {\footnotesize({\it circle one})} reach $(1,0)$.


{\bf Definition} The set of positions the robot can visit  $P$ is defined by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
    \textrm{Basis Step: } & (0,0) \in P \\
    \textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{If } (x,y) \in P  \textrm{, then } 
    \phantom{(x+1, y+1), (x+1, y-1), (x-1, y-1), (x-1, y+1)} \textrm{ are also in } P
\end{array}
\]

{\it Example elements of $P$ are}:
\vspace{40pt}

{\bf Lemma}: $\forall (x,y) \in P( x+y \textrm{ is an even integer}~)$

{\it Why are we calling this a lemma?}


Proof of theorem using lemma: To show is $(1,0) \notin P$. Rewriting the lemma to explicitly 
restrict the domain of the universal, 
we have $\forall (x,y) ~(~ (x,y) \in P  \to (x+y \textrm{ is an even integer})~)$.  Since
the universal is true, 
$ (~ (1,0) \in P \to (1+0 \textrm{ is an even integer})~)$ is a true statement.
Evaluating the conclusion of this conditional statement: 
By definition of long division, since $1 = 0 \cdot 2 + 1$ (where $0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and 
$1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $0 \leq 1 < 2$ mean that $0$ is the quotient and $1$ is the remainder), $1 ~\textrm{\bf mod}~ 2 = 1$ which is not $0$ 
so the conclusion is false.  A true conditional with a false conclusion must have a false hypothesis.
Thus, $(1,0) \notin P$, QED. $\square$

\section*{Structural induction example sum of powers}


The set $\mathbb{N}$ is recursively defined.
Therefore, the function $sumPow: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
which computes, for input $i$, the sum of the nonnegative powers of $2$
up to and including exponent $i$ is defined
recursively by

\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \text{Basis step:  } \qquad & sumPow(0) = 1 &\\
    \text{Recursive step:  } & \text{If } x \in \mathbb{N} \text{, then } &sumPow(x+1) = sumPow(x) + 2^{x+1}
\end{alignat*}

$sumPow(0) =$

\vspace{20pt}

$sumPow(1) =$

\vspace{20pt}

$sumPow(2) =$

\vspace{20pt}


Fill in the blanks in the following proof of 
\[
    \forall n \in \mathbb{N}~(sumPow(n) = 2^{n+1} - 1)
\]

{\bf Proof}: Since $\mathbb{N}$ is recursively defined, we proceed by \underline{\phantom{structural induction \hspace{0.3in}}}.

{\bf Basis case}: We need to show that \underline{\phantom{$sumPow(0) = 2^{0+1} - 1$ \hspace{0.2in}}}.
Evaluating each side: $LHS = sumPow(0) = 1$ by the basis case in the recursive definition
of $sumPow$; $RHS = 2^{0+1} - 1 = 2^1 - 1 = 2-1 = 1$. Since $1=1$, the equality holds.

{\bf Recursive case}: Consider arbitrary natural number $n$ and assume, as the 
\underline{\phantom{Induction Hypothesis (IH)}} that $sumPow(n) = 2^{n+1} - 1$. We need to show that
\underline{\phantom{$sumPow(n+1) = 2^{(n+1) + 1} - 1$}}.  Evaluating each side: 
\[
LHS = sumPow(n+1) \overset{\text{rec def}}{=} sumPow(n)  + 2^{n+1}\overset{\text{IH}}{=} (2^{n+1} - 1) + 2^{n+1}.
\]
\[
RHS = 2^{(n+1)+1}- 1 \overset{\text{exponent rules}}{=} 2 \cdot 2^{n+1} -1  = \left(2^{n+1} + 2^{n+1} \right) - 1
\overset{\text{regrouping}}{=}  (2^{n+1} - 1) + 2^{n+1} 
\]
Thus, $LHS = RHS$. The structural induction is complete and we have proved the universal generalization.

\section*{Binary expansions exist proof}


{\bf Theorem}: Every positive integer is a sum of (one or more) distinct powers of $2$.
{\it Binary expansions exist!}

Recall the definition for binary expansion:



{\bf Definition} For $n$ a positive integer, 
the {\bf binary expansion of $n$}  is
\[
(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b
\]
where $k$ is a positive integer, $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}$ 
are each $0$ or $1$, $a_{k-1} \neq  0$, and
\[
n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}
\]
 

The idea in the ``Least significant first" algorithm 
for computing binary expansions is that the binary
expansion of {\it half} a number becomes {\it part} of the binary expansion of 
the number of itself. We can use this 
idea in a proof by strong induction that binary expansions exist for all 
positive integers $n$.


{\bf Proof by strong induction}, with $b=1$ and $j=0$.


{\bf Basis step}:  WTS property is true about  $1$.

\phantom{Choose $a_0 = 1$, then $(a_0)_2 = 1 \cdot 2^0 = 1$.}
\vspace{80pt}


{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 1$.

Assume (as the strong induction hypothesis, IH) that the property is true about  each of $1, \ldots, n$.  

WTS that the property is true about $n+1$.

{\it Idea}: We will apply the IH to $(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2$.

{\it Why is this ok?}

\phantom{Notice that $(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2$ is greater than or equal to 
$1$ and less than or equal to $n$ because $n \geq 1$.}
\vspace{100pt}

{\it Why is this helpful?}

By the IH, we can write $(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2$ as 
a sum of powers of $2$. In other words, 
there are values $a_{k-1}, \ldots, a_0$ such that each $a_i$ is $0$ or $1$, $a_{k-1} = 1$, 
and
\[
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i 2^i = (n+1) \textbf{ div } 2   
\]
Define the collection of coefficients
\[
   c_{j} = 
   \begin{cases}
        a_{j-1} \qquad&\text{if $1 \leq j \leq k$}\\
        (n+1) \textbf{ mod } 2 &\text{if $j = 0$}
   \end{cases}
\]
Calculating: 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
    \sum_{j=0}^k c_j 2^j &= c_0 + \sum_{j=1}^k c_j 2^j 
    = c_0 + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_{i+1} 2^{i+1} &\qquad &\text{re-indexing the summation}\\
    &= c_0 + 2 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c_{i+1}2^i &\qquad &\text{factoring out a $2$ from each term in the sum}\\
    &= c_0 + 2 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} 2^i &\qquad &\text{by definition of $c_{i+1}$}\\
    &= c_0 + 2 \left(~(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2 ~\right) &\qquad &\text{by IH} \\
    &= \left(~ (n+1) \textbf{ mod } 2 ~\right ) + 2 \left(~(n+1) \textbf{ div } 2 ~\right) &\qquad &\text{by definition of $c_0$} \\
    &= n+1 &\qquad&\text{by definition of long division}
\end{alignat*}

Thus, $n+1$ can be expressed as a sum of powers of $2$, as required. \vfill
\section*{Fundamental theorem proof}


{\bf Theorem}: Every positive integer {\it greater than 1} is a product of (one or more) primes.

{\bf Before we prove, let's try some examples}:

$20 = $

$100 = $

$5 = $


{\bf Proof by strong induction}, with $b=2$ and $j=0$.

{\bf Basis step}:  WTS property is true about  $2$.

Since $2$ is itself prime,
it is already written as a product of (one) prime.


{\bf Recursive step}: Consider an arbitrary integer $n \geq 2$.
Assume (as the strong induction hypothesis, IH) that the property is true about  each of $2, \ldots, n$.  
WTS that the property is true about  $n+1$: We want to show that $n+1$ can be written 
as a product of primes.  Notice that $n+1$ is itself prime or it is composite.

{\it Case 1}: assume $n+1$ is prime and then immediately it is written as a product
of (one) prime so we are done.  

{\it Case 2}: assume that $n+1$ is composite
so there are integers $x$ and $y$ where $n+1 = xy$ and each of them is between $2$ and $n$
(inclusive).  Therefore, the induction hypothesis applies to each of $x$ and $y$ so each 
of these factors of $n+1$ can be written as a product of primes.  Multiplying these products together, 
we get a product of primes that gives $n+1$, as required. 

Since both cases give the necessary
conclusion, the proof by cases for the recursive step is complete. \vfill
\section*{Strong induction making change proof idea}


Suppose we had postage stamps worth $5$ cents and $3$ cents.
Which number of cents can we form using these stamps?
In other words, which postage can we pay?

$11$? 

$15$? 


$4$?



\begin{align*}
    &CanPay(0) \land \lnot CanPay(1) \land \lnot CanPay(2) \land \\
    &CanPay(3) \land \lnot CanPay(4) \land CanPay(5) \land CanPay(6) \\
    &\lnot CanPay(7) \land \forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{\geq 8} CanPay(n)
\end{align*}

where the predicate $CanPay$ with domain $\mathbb{N}$ is
\[
    CanPay(n) = \exists x \in \mathbb{N} \exists y \in \mathbb{N}  ( 5x+3y = n)
\]


{\bf Proof} (idea): First, explicitly give witnesses or general arguments
for postages between $0$ and $7$. 
To prove the universal claim, we can use mathematical induction or strong induction.

{\it Approach 1, mathematical induction}: if we have
stamps that add up to $n$ cents, need to use them (and others)
to give $n+1$ cents. How do we get $1$ cent with just $3$-cent
and $5$-cent stamps?

\vspace{-10pt}
Either \underline{take away a $5$-cent stamps and add two $3$-cent stamps},

\vspace{-10pt}
or \underline{take away three $3$-cent stamps and add two $5$-cent stamps}.

\vspace{-10pt}
The details of this proof by mathematical induction
are making sure we have enough 
stamps to use one of these approaches.

{\it Approach 2, strong induction}: assuming we know how to make postage
for {\bf all} smaller values (greater than or equal to $8$), when
we need to make $n+1$ cents, \underline{add one $3$ cent stamp to 
however we make $(n+1) - 3$ cents}.

\vspace{-10pt}
The details of this proof by strong induction are making sure we 
stay in the domain of the universal when applying the induction hypothesis.

\section*{Strong induction nim}


Consider the following game: two players start with 
two (equal) piles of jellybeans in front of them.
They take turns removing any positive integer number
of jellybeans at a time from one of two piles in 
front of them in turns.

The player who removes the last jellybean wins the game.

Which player (if any) has a strategy to guarantee
to win the game?


Try out some games, starting with $1$ jellybean in each pile,
then $2$ jellybeans in each pile, then $3$ jellybeans in each pile.
Who wins in each game?

\vspace{200pt}


Notice that reasoning about the strategy for the $1$ jellybean 
game is easier than about the strategy for the $2$ jellybean game.

{\it Formulate a winning strategy by working to 
transform the game to a simpler one we know we can win.}

\newpage

{\it Player 2's Strategy}: Take the same number of jellybeans that Player 1 did, 
but from the opposite pile. 


{\it Why is this a good idea}: If Player 2 plays this strategy, at the next turn
Player 1 faces a game with the same setup as the original, just with fewer
jellybeans in the two piles. Then Player 2 can keep playing this strategy to win.

{\bf Claim}: Player 2's strategy guarantees they will win the game.

{\bf Proof}: By strong induction, we will prove that for all positive 
integers $n$, Player 2's strategy guarantees a win in the game that starts with 
$n$ jellybeans in each pile.

{\bf Basis step}: WTS Player 2's strategy guarantees a win 
when each pile starts with $1$ jellybean.

In this case, Player 1 has to take the jellybean from one of the piles
(because they can't take from both piles at once).
Following the strategy, Player 2 takes the jellybean from the 
other pile, and wins because this is the last jellybean.

{\bf Recursive step}: Let $n$ be a positive integer. 
As the strong induction hypothesis, assume that
Player 2's strategy guarantees a win in the games 
where there are $1, 2, \ldots, n$ many jellybeans in each 
pile at the start of the game.

WTS that Player 2's strategy guarantees a win in the game where
there are $n+1$ in the jellybeans in each pile at the start of the game.

In this game, the first move has Player 1 take 
some number, call it $c$ (where $1 \leq c \leq n+1$),
of jellybeans from one of the piles. 
Playing according to their strategy, Player 2 then 
takes the same number of jellybeans from  the other pile.

Notice that $(c = n+1) \lor (c \leq n)$.

{\it Case 1}: Assume $c = n+1$, then in their first move, 
Player 2 wins because they take all of the second pile, which 
includes the last jellybean.

{\it Case 2}: Assume $c \leq n$. Then after Player 2's first move,
the two piles have an equal number of jellybeans. The number
of jellybeans in each pile is 
\[
    (n+1) - c
\]
and, since $1 \leq c \leq n$, this number is between $1$ and $n$.
Thus, at this stage of the game, the game appears identical to a new 
game where the two piles have an equal number of jellybeans between $1$
and $n$. Thus, the strong induction hypothesis applies, and Player 2's
strategy guarantees they win.

is the greatest common factor it is greater than or equal to any common factor.}

\section*{Gcd lemma relatively prime}


{\bf Lemma}: For any integers $p, q$ (not both zero), 
$gcd \left(~ \left(~\frac{p}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}, \frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)} ~\right) ~\right) = 1$ .
In other words, can reduce to relatively prime integers by dividing by gcd.

{\bf Proof}:

Let $x$ be arbitrary positive integer and assume that $x$ is a 
factor of each of $\frac{p}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}$ and $\frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}$. 
This gives integers $\alpha$, $\beta$ such that 
\[
    \alpha x = \frac{p}{gcd(~(p,q)~)} \qquad \qquad \beta x = \frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}
\]
Multiplying both sides by the denominator in the RHS: 
\[
    \alpha x \cdot gcd(~(p,q)~)= p \qquad \qquad \beta x \cdot gcd(~(p,q)~)= q
\]
In other words, $x \cdot gcd(~(p,q)~)$ is a common divisor of $p, q$. By definition of $gcd$, this means
\[
    x \cdot gcd (~(p,q)~) \leq gcd (~(p,q)~)
\]
and since $gcd(~(p,q)~)$ is positive, this means, $x \leq 1$.

\section*{Proof by contradiction irrational}


{\bf Goal}:  The square root of $2$ is not a rational number.  In other words: $\neg \exists x \in \mathbb{Q} ( x^2 -  2 = 0)$

{\bf Attempted proof}: The definition of the set of rational numbers is the collection of fractions $p/q$ where $p$ is an integer and $q$ is a nonzero integer. Looking for a {\bf witness} $p$ and $q$, we can write the square root of $2$ as the fraction 
$\sqrt{2 }/1$, where $1$ is a nonzero integer. Since the numerator is not in the domain, this witness is not allowed, and we have shown that the square root of $2$ is not a fraction of integers (with nonzero denominator). Thus, the square root of $2$ is not rational.


{\it The problem in the above attempted proof is that} \underline{\phantom{it only considers one candidate witness
and does not prove that no witnesses exist.}}


{\bf Lemma 1:} For every two integers $a$ and  $b$, not both zero, with  $gcd(~(a,b)~) = 1$, it is not the case that both $a$
is  even and $b$ is even.


{\bf Lemma 2:} For every integer  $x$, $x$ is  even if and only if $x^2$  is even.


{\bf Proof}: Towards a proof by contradiction, we will define a statement 
$r$ such that $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q} \to (r \land \lnot r)$. 

Assume that $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Namely, there are positive integers
$p, q$ such that 
\[
    \sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}
\]
Let $a= \frac{p}{gcd( ~(p,q)~)}$, $b = \frac{q}{gcd(~(p,q)~)}$, then 
\[
    \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} \qquad \text{and} \qquad gcd(~(a,b)~) = 1
\]

By Lemma 1, $a$ and $b$ are not both even. We define $r$ to be the 
statement ``$a$ is even and $b$ is even'', and we have proved $\lnot r$.

Squaring both sides and clearing denominator: $2b^2 = a^2$.

By definition of even, since $b^2$ is an integer$, a^2$ is even.

By Lemma 2, this guarantees that $a$ is even too. So, by 
definition of even, there is some integer (call it $c$), such that $a = 2c$.

Plugging into the equation:
\[
    2b^2 = a^2 = (2c)^2 = 4c^2
\]
and dividing both sides by $2$
\[
    b^2 = 2c^2
\]
and since $c^2$ is an integer, $b^2$ is even. By Lemma 2, $b$ is even too.
Thus, $a$ is even and $b$ is even and we have proved $r$. 

In other words, assuming that $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$ guarantees $r \land \lnot r$, 
which is impossible, so $\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$. QED

In a {\bf combinatorial circuit} (also known as

connected
by {\bf wires}. The inputs to the circuits are the 
values set on the input wires: possible
values are 0 (low) or 1 (high). The values
flow along the wires from left to right.
A wire may be split into two or more wires, 
indicated with a filled-in circle (representing
solder). Values stay the same along a wire. When 
one or more wires flow into a gate, the output 
value of that gate is computed
from the input values based on the gate's definition
table. Outputs of gates may become inputs to other
gates.  \vfill

\section*{Netflix intro}


What data should we encode about each Netflix account holder to help us make effective recommendations?

\vfill
\vfill

In machine learning, clustering can be used to group similar data for prediction and recommendation.  For example,
each Netflix user's viewing history can be represented as a $n$-tuple indicating their preferences about
movies in the database, where $n$ is the number of movies in the database.  People with similar tastes in movies can then be clustered to provide recommendations
of movies for one another.  Mathematically, clustering is based on a notion of distance between pairs of $n$-tuples.

\section*{Set operations}


\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{To define a set we can use the roster method, set builder notation, a recursive definition, 
and also we can apply a set operation to other sets. \\

{\bf New! Cartesian product of sets} and {\bf set-wise concatenation of sets of strings}\\


{\bf Definition}: Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.  The {\bf Cartesian product} of $X$ and $Y$, denoted
$X \times Y$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$
\[
X \times Y = \{ (x,y) \mid x \in X \text{ and } y \in Y \}
\]
{\bf Definition}: Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets of strings over the same alphabet. The {\bf set-wise concatenation} 
of $X$ and $Y$, denoted $X \circ Y$, is the set of all results of string concatenation $xy$ where $x \in X$ 
and $y \in Y$
\[
X \circ Y = \{ xy \mid x \in X \text{ and } y \in Y \}
\]
}}

{\bf Pro-tip}: the meaning of writing one element next to another like $xy$ depends on the data-types of $x$ and 
$y$. When $x$ and $y$ are strings, the convention is that $xy$ is the result of string concatenation. 
When $x$ and $y$ are numbers, the convention is that $xy$ is the result of multiplication. This is 
(one of the many reasons) why is it very important to declare the data-type of variables before we use them.

\section*{Defining functions recursively}


When the domain of a function is a {\it recursively defined set}, the rule assigning 
images to domain elements (outputs) can also be defined recursively.

Recall: The set of RNA strands $S$ is defined (recursively) by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \A \in S, \C \in S, \U \in S, \G \in S \\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{If } s \in S\textrm{ and }b \in B \textrm{, then }sb \in S
\end{array}
\]
where $sb$ is string concatenation.

{\bf Definition} (Of a function, recursively) A function \textit{rnalen} that computes the length of RNA strands in $S$ is defined by:
\[
\begin{array}{llll}
& & \textit{rnalen} : S & \to \mathbb{Z}^+ \\
\textrm{Basis Step:} & \textrm{If } b \in B\textrm{ then } & \textit{rnalen}(b) & = 1 \\
\textrm{Recursive Step:} & \textrm{If } s \in S\textrm{ and }b \in B\textrm{, then  } & \textit{rnalen}(sb) & = 1 + \textit{rnalen}(s)
\end{array}
\]

The domain of \textit{rnalen} is \phantom{$S$}\\

The codomain of \textit{rnalen} is \phantom{$\mathbb{Z}^+$}\\

Example function application:
\[
rnalen(\A\C\U) = \phantom{1+ rnalen(\A\C) = 1 + (1 + rnalen(\A) ) = 1 + ( 1 + 1) = 3}
\]

\vfill

{\it Extra example}: A function \textit{basecount} that computes the number of a given base 
$b$ appearing in a RNA strand $s$ is defined recursively:
    
\[
\begin{array}{llll}
& & \textit{basecount} : S \times B & \to \mathbb{N} \\
\textrm{Basis Step:} &  \textrm{If } b_1 \in B, b_2 \in B & \textit{basecount}(~(b_1, b_2)~) & =
        \begin{cases}
            1 & \textrm{when } b_1 = b_2 \\
            0 & \textrm{when } b_1 \neq b_2 \\
        \end{cases} \\
\textrm{Recursive Step:} & \textrm{If } s \in S, b_1 \in B, b_2 \in B &\textit{basecount}(~(s b_1, b_2)~) & =
        \begin{cases}
            1 + \textit{basecount}(~(s, b_2)~) & \textrm{when } b_1 = b_2 \\
            \textit{basecount}(~(s, b_2)~) & \textrm{when } b_1 \neq b_2 \\
        \end{cases}
\end{array}
\]

$basecount(~(\A\C\U,\A)~) = basecount( ~(\A\C, \A)~) = basecount(~(\A, \A)~) = 1$\\


$basecount(~(\A\C\U,\G)~) = basecount( ~(\A\C, \G)~) = basecount(~(\A, \G)~) = 0$\\


\vfill
{\it Extra example}: The function which outputs $2^n$ when given a nonnegative integer $n$ can be defined recursively, 
because its domain is the set of nonnegative integers.

{\bf Integer division and remainders} (aka The Division Algorithm) Let $n$ be an integer

\section*{Equivalence relations partitions}


{\it Recall:} 


A relation is an {\bf equivalence relation} means it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. 

An {\bf equivalence class} of an element $a \in A$ 
with respect to an equivalence relation $R$ on the set $A$ is the set 
\[
    \{s \in A \mid (a, s) \in R \}
\] 
We write $[a]_R$ for this set, which is the equivalence class of $a$ with respect to $R$. 

A {\bf partition} of a set $A$ is a set of non-empty, disjoint subsets 
$A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_n$ such that 
\[
    A = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \{ x \mid \exists i (x \in A_i) \}
\] 
{\bf Claim}: For each  $a \in U$, $[a]_{E}  \neq  \emptyset$.

{\bf Proof}: Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ 
consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $U$. 
We will work to show that $[a]_E \neq \emptyset$, namely that $\exists x \in [a]_E$.
By definition of equivalence classes, we can rewrite this goal as 
$$\exists x \in U ~( ~(a,x) \in E~)$$ 
Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$, consider $x = a$, 
an element of $U$ by definition. By $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ of $E$, 
we know that $(a,a) \in E$  and thus the existential quantification has been proved.\\


{\bf Claim}: For each $a \in U$, there is some $b \in U$  such that $a \in [b]_{E}$.

Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$ 
consider an arbitrary element $a$ in $U$. By definition of equivalence classes, 
we can rewrite the goal as 
$$\exists b \in U ~( ~(b,a) \in E~)$$
Towards a $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$, consider $b = a$, 
an element of $U$ by definition. By $\underline{\phantom{\hspace{1.3in}}}$  of $E$, 
we know that $(a,a) \in E$  and thus the existential quantification has been proved. \\
 
{\bf Claim}: For each  $a,b  \in U$ , $(~(a,b)  \in  E ~\to ~ [a]_{E}  = [b]_{E}~)$
and  $(~(a,b)  \notin  E ~\to ~ [a]_{E} \cap[b]_{E} = \emptyset~)$

\phantom{Let $a,b$ be arbitrary. For first goal, assume towards
direct proof that $(a,b) \in E$. To show $[a]_E = [b]_E$ 
first consider arbitrary element $x$ in $[a]_E$. By definition
$(a,x) \in E$ so by symmetry, $(x,a) \in E$ and by 
transitivity with assumption, $(x,b)\in E$. Thus, by definition
of equivalence class, $x \in [b]_E$. Similarly, take arbitrary
element $y \in [b]_E$. By definition $(y,b) \in E$ 
and applying symmetry to assumption, we have $(b,a) \in E$
so by transitivity $(y,a) \in E$ and $y \in[a]_E$, as required
to complete the proof of set equality. For the second goal, 
assume (towards a proof by contrapositive) that $[a]_E \cap [b]_E 
\neq \emptyset$. Then there is a witness $w \in [a]_E \cap [b]_E$.
By definition of equivalence classes $(a,w) \in E$ and $(b,w) \in E$.
By symmetry, we have $(w,b) \in E$ so by transitivity $(a,b) \in E$,
as required.}

{\bf Corollary}: Given an equivalence relation $E$ on set $U$,  
$\{ [x]_{E} \mid x \in U  \}$ is a partition of $U$.

\section*{Equivalence relations examples ratings}


Recall that 
in a movie recommendation system, each 
user's ratings of movies is represented as a $n$-tuple 
(with the positive integer $n$ 
being the number of movies in the database), 
and each component of 
the $n$-tuple is an element of the collection $\{-1,0,1\}$. 

We call $Rt_5$ the set of all ratings $5$-tuples.

Define $d: Rt_5 \times Rt_5 \to \mathbb{N}$ by
\[
    d (~(~ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5) ~) ~) = \sum_{i=1}^5 |x_i - y_i|
\]

Consider the following binary relations on $Rt_5$.
\[
    E_{proj} =  \{ ( ~(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5)~) \in
         Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~(x_1 = y_1) \land  (x_2 = y_2) \land (x_3 = y_3) \}

\section*{Netflix clustering scenario}


{\bf Scenario}: Good morning! You're a user experience engineer at Netflix. A
product goal is to design customized home pages for groups of users who have
similar interests. Your manager tasks you with designing an algorithm for
producing a clustering of users based on their movie interests,
so that customized homepages can be engineered for each group.

{\bf Conventions for today}: 
We will use $U = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_t\}$ to 
refer to an arbitrary set of user ratings (we'll pick some 
specific examples to explore) that are a subset of $Rt_5$. 
We will be interested in creating partitions $C_1, \cdots, C_m$ of 
$U$. We'll assume that each user represented by an element of $U$ 
has a unique ratings tuple.


Your idea: equivalence relations! You offer your manager three great options: 

\[
    E_{id} = \{ ( ~(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)~) \mid 
    (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) \in Rt_5  \}
\]

{\it Describe how each homepage should be designed \ldots }

\vspace{100pt}



\[
    E_{proj} =  \{ ( ~(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5), (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5)~) \in
         Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~(x_1 = y_1) \land  (x_2 = y_2) \land (x_3 = y_3) \}
\]


{\it Describe how each homepage should be designed \ldots }

\vspace{100pt}

\[
E_{circ} =  \{ (u,v) \in Rt_5 \times Rt_5 ~\mid~ d(~ ( ~(0,0,0,0,0)~, u)~ ) =  d( ~(~(0,0,0,0,0),v~)~) \}
\]

{\it Describe how each homepage should be designed \ldots }


\vspace{100pt}


{\bf Scenario}: Good morning! You're a user experience engineer at Netflix. A
product goal is to design customized home pages for groups of users who have
similar interests. You task your team with designing an algorithm for
producing a clustering of users based on their movie interests. Your team
implements two algorithms that produce different clusterings. How do you
decide which one to use? What feedback do you give the team in order to help
them improve? Clearly, you will need to use math.


Your idea: find a way to {\bf score} clusterings (partitions) 


{\bf Definition}: For a cluster of ratings $C = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n \} 
\subseteq U$, the {\bf diameter} of the cluster is defined by:

$$\textit{diameter}(C) = \max_{1 \leq i, j \leq n} (d(~(r_i, r_j)~))$$ 

Consider $x = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)$, $y = (1, 1, 1, 0, 1)$, $z = (-1, -1, 0, 0, 0)$, $w = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)$.

What is $\textit{diameter}(\{x, y, z\})$? $\textit{diameter}(\{x, y\})$? $\textit{diameter}(\{x, z, w\})$?

\vspace{100pt}

\textit{diameter} works on single clusters. One way to aggregate across a
clustering $C_1, \cdots, C_m$ is $\sum_{k=1}^m diameter(C_k)$


Is this a good score?

\vspace{100pt}

How can we express the idea of {\bf many elements within a small area}? Key idea: ``give credit'' to small diameter clusters with many elements.

{\bf Definition}: For a cluster of ratings $C = \{r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_n \} 
\subseteq U$, the {\bf density} of the cluster is defined by:
\[
    \frac{n}{1+ diameter(C)}
\]



\newpage

Can you use density to decide whether the partition given by 
the equivalence classes of $E_{proj}$ or $E_{circ}$ for this task? \vfill

\section*{Set construction final review}


The bases of RNA strands are elements of the set $B = \{\A, \C, \G, \U \}$. 
The set of RNA strands $S$ is defined (recursively) by:
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{Basis Step: } & \A \in S, \C \in S, \U \in S, \G \in S \\
\textrm{Recursive Step: } & \textrm{If } s \in S\textrm{ and }b \in B \textrm{, then }sb \in S
\end{array}
\]
where $sb$ is string concatenation.

Each of the sets below is described using set builder notation. Rewrite them using the roster method. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{s \in S ~|~ \text{the leftmost base in $s$ is the same as the rightmost base in $s$ and 
$s$ has length $3$} \}$ 

\vspace{50pt}

\item $\{s \in S ~|~ \text{there are twice as many $\A$s as $\C$s in $s$ and $s$ has length $1$} \}$

Certain 
 sequences of bases serve important biological functions in translating RNA to proteins. The following
 recursive definition gives a special set of RNA strands: The set of RNA strands $\hat{S}$ is defined (recursively)
 by 
 
 \begin{alignat*}{2}

\text{Recursive step:} & \qquad& \text{If } s \in \hat{S} \text{ and } x \in R \text{, then } sx\in \hat{S}\\
