\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use and design automata both formally and informally, including DFA, NFA, PDA, TM.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describe the language recognized by a Turing machine
        \item Determine if a Turing machine is a decider
    \end{itemize}
\item Explain the Church-Turing thesis and use it to operationalize the notion of algorithm
    \begin{itemize}
        \item State and use the Church-Turing thesis
        \item Use high-level descriptions to define and trace Turing machines
        \item Apply dovetailing in high-level definitions of machines
    \end{itemize}
\item Translate a decision problem to a set of strings coding the problem.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Connect languages and computational problems
        \item Describe and use the encoding of objects as inputs to Turing machines
        \item Describe common computational problems with respect to DFA, NFA, regular expressions, PDA, and context-free grammars.
        \item Give high-level descriptions of Turing machines that decide common computational problems with respect to DFA, NFA, regular expressions, PDA, and context-free grammars.
        \item Give examples of decidable problems.
        \item Trace high-level descriptions of algorithms for computational problems
    \end{itemize}
