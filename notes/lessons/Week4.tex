\subsubsection*{We will be learning and practicing to:}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Give examples of sets that are regular (and prove that they are).
       \begin{itemize}
          \item {\bf State the definition of the class of regular languages}
          \item {\bf Explain the limits of the class of regular languages}
          \item {\bf Identify some regular sets and some nonregular sets}
       \end{itemize}
       \item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of a PDA
       \item Use clear English to describe computations of PDA informally.
       \begin{itemize}
           \item {\bf Define push-down automata informally and formally}
           \item {\bf State the formal definition of a PDA}
           \item {\bf Trace the computation(s) of a PDA on a given string using its state diagram}
           \item {\bf Determine if a given string is in the language recognized by a PDA}
           \item {\bf Translate between a state diagram and a formal deÔ¨Ånition of a PDA}
           \item {\bf Determine the language recognized by a given PDA}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Describe and use models of computation that don't involve state machines.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\bf Identify the components of a formal definition of a context-free grammar (CFG)}
            \item {\bf Derive strings in the language of a given CFG}
            \item {\bf Determine the language of a given CFG}
            \item {\bf Design a CFG generating a given language}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
