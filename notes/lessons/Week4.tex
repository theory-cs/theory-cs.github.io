\subsubsection*{We will be learning and practicing to:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Give examples of sets that are regular (and prove that they are).
       \begin{itemize}
          \item {\bf State the definition of the class of regular languages}
          \item {\bf Explain the limits of the class of regular languages}
          \item {\bf Identify some regular sets and some nonregular sets}
       \end{itemize}
       \item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of a PDA
       \item Use clear English to describe computations of PDA informally.
       \begin{itemize}
           \item {\bf Define push-down automata informally and formally}
           \item {\bf State the formal definition of a PDA}
           \item {\bf Trace the computation(s) of a PDA on a given string using its state diagram}
           \item {\bf Determine if a given string is in the language recognized by a PDA}
           \item {\bf Translate between a state diagram and a formal deÔ¨Ånition of a PDA}
           \item {\bf Determine the language recognized by a given PDA}
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Apply classical techniques including pumping lemma, determinization, diagonalization, and reduction to analyze the complexity of languages and problems.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf Justify why the Pumping Lemma is true.}
        \item {\bf Use the pumping lemma to prove that a given language is not regular.}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
