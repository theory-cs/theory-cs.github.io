\section*{Let's get started}

We want you to be successful. 

We will work together to build an 
environment in CSE 105 that supports your learning
in a way that respects your
perspectives, experiences, and identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, 
class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).Â  
Our goal is for you to  engage
with interesting and challenging concepts and 
feel comfortable exploring, asking questions, and thriving.

If you or someone you know is suffering from food and/or housing insecurities 
there are UCSD resources here to help:

Basic Needs Office: \href{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}

Triton Food Pantry (in the old Student Center)
is free and anonymous, and includes produce: 

\href{https://www.facebook.com/tritonfoodpantry/}{https://www.facebook.com/tritonfoodpantry/}

Mutual Aid UCSD: \href{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}

Financial aid resources, the possibility of emergency grant funding, and off-campus housing referral 
resources are available: see your College Dean of Student Affairs.

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help. 
We are committed to upholding University policies regarding nondiscrimination, sexual violence and sexual harassment.
Here are some campus contacts that could provide this help: 
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858 534-3755 or \href{http://caps.ucsd.edu}{http://caps.ucsd.edu}; 
OPHD at 858 534-8298 or ophd@ucsd.edu , \href{http://ophd.ucsd.edu}{http://ophd.ucsd.edu};
CARE at Sexual Assault Resource Center at 858 534-5793 or sarc@ucsd.edu , \href{http://care.ucsd.edu}{http://care.ucsd.edu}.


Please reach out (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you need support with extenuating circumstances affecting CSE 105.

Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Fall 2024!

\section*{CSE 105's Big Questions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What problems are computers capable of solving?
   \item What resources are needed to solve a problem?
   \item Are some problems harder than others?
\end{itemize}

In this context, a {\bf problem} is defined as: ``Making a decision or computing a value based on some input"

Consider the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Find a file on your computer
   \item Determine if your code will compile
   \item Find a run-time error in your code
   \item Certify that your system is un-hackable
\end{itemize}

Which of these is hardest?

\vfill

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.

To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

\subsection*{Weeks 0 and 1 at a glance}

\subsubsection*{Textbook reading: Chapter 0, Sections 1.3, 1.1}

\vspace{-15pt}

Before Monday, review class syllabus on Canvas (https://canvas.ucsd.edu/) and 
read Example 1.51 and Definition 1.52 (definition of regular expressions) on page 64.
{\it Notice}: we are jumping to Section 1.3 and then will come back 
to Section 1.1 on Wednesday.

Before Wednesday, read Figure 1.4 and Definition 1.5 (definition of finite automata) on pages 34-35.

Before Friday, read the definition of the union, concatenation, and star operations for languages is given 
as Definition 1.23 on page 44 and a useful example is Example 1.24.

For Week 2 Monday: Pages 41-43 (Figures 1.18, 1.19, 1.20) (examples of automata and languages).


{\it Textbook references: Within a chapter, each item is numbered consecutively. Figure 1.22
is the twenty-second numbered item in chapter one; it comes right after Example 1.21 and right before Definition 1.23.}


\subsubsection*{We will be learning and practicing to:}
%Define decision problem, Regular expressions, Formal definition of automata, Informal definition of automata
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Translate a decision problem to a set of strings coding the problem.
   \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf Distinguish between alphabet, language, sets, and strings}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Use regular expressions and relate them to languages and automata.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Write and debug regular expressions using correct syntax}
      \item {\bf Determine if a given string is in the language described by a regular expression}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of finite automata.
   \item Use clear English to describe computations of finite automata informally.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf State the formal definition of (deterministic) finite automata}   
      \item {\bf Trace the computation of a finite automaton on a given string using its state diagram}
      \item {\bf Translate between a state diagram and a formal definition}
      \item {\bf Determine if a given string is in the language recognized by a finite automaton}
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%\item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. Reason about computation and systems. Use mathematical techniques to solve problems. Determine appropriate conceptual tools to apply to new situations. Know when tools do not apply and try different approaches. Critically analyze and evaluate candidate solutions.
%\begin{itemize}
%   \item 
%\end{itemize}

%\item Understand, guide, shape impact of computing on society/the world. Connect the role of Theory CS classes to other applications (in undergraduate CS curriculum and beyond). Model problems using appropriate mathematical concepts.
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item 
%\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{TODO:}
\begin{list}{\itemsep-10pt}
   \item \#FinAid Assignment on Canvas (complete as soon as possible) and read syllabus on Canvas
   \item Schedule your Test 1 Attempt 1, Test 2 Attempt 1, Test 1 Attempt 2, and Test 2 Attempt 2 times 
   at PrairieTest (http://us.prairietest.com)
   \item Review Quiz on PrairieLearn (http://us.prairielearn.com), complete by Sunday 10/6/2024
   \item Create a homework group, possibly by using the Piazza (https://piazza.com/) find-a-teammate tool
   \item Homework 1 submitted via Gradescope (https://www.gradescope.com/), due Tuesday 10/8/2024
