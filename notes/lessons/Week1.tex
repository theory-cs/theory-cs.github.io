\section*{Let's get started}

We want you to be successful. 

We will work together to build an 
environment in CSE 105 that supports your learning
in a way that respects your
perspectives, experiences, and identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, 
class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).Â  
Our goal is for you to  engage
with interesting and challenging concepts and 
feel comfortable exploring, asking questions, and thriving.\\

If you are skipping and stretching meals, or having difficulties affording or accessing food, you may be eligible for CalFresh, California's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, that can provide up to \$292 a month in free money on a debit card to buy food. Students can apply at \url{benefitscal.com/r/ucsandiegocalfresh}.
The Hub Basic Needs Center empowers all students by connecting them to resources for food, stable housing and financial literacy. Visit their site at \url{basicneeds.ucsd.edu}.

Financial aid resources, the possibility of emergency grant funding, and off-campus housing referral 
resources are available: see your College Dean of Student Affairs.

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help. 
We are committed to upholding University policies regarding nondiscrimination, sexual violence and sexual harassment.
Here are some campus contacts that could provide this help: 
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858 534-3755 or \href{http://caps.ucsd.edu}{http://caps.ucsd.edu}; 
OPHD at 858 534-8298 or ophd@ucsd.edu , \href{http://ophd.ucsd.edu}{http://ophd.ucsd.edu};
CARE at Sexual Assault Resource Center at 858 534-5793 or sarc@ucsd.edu , \href{http://care.ucsd.edu}{http://care.ucsd.edu}.


Please reach out (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you need support with extenuating circumstances affecting CSE 105.

Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Winter 2025!

\section*{CSE 105's Big Questions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What problems are computers capable of solving?
   \item What resources are needed to solve a problem?
   \item Are some problems harder than others?
\end{itemize}

In this context, a {\bf problem} is defined as: ``Making a decision or computing a value based on some input"

Consider the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Find a file on your computer
   \item Determine if your code will compile
   \item Find a run-time error in your code
   \item Certify that your system is un-hackable
\end{itemize}

Which of these is hardest?

\vfill

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.

To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

\subsection*{Weeks 0 and 1 at a glance}

\subsubsection*{Textbook reading: Chapter 0, Sections 1.3, 1.1}

\vspace{-15pt}

Before Monday, review class syllabus on Canvas (https://canvas.ucsd.edu/).

Before Wednesday, read Example 1.51.

{\it Notice}: we are jumping to Section 1.3 and then will come back 
to Section 1.1 next week.

Before Friday, read Definition 1.52 (definition of regular expressions) on page 64.

For Week 2 Monday: Figure 1.4 and Definition 1.5 (definition of finite automata) on pages 34-35.

{\it Textbook references: Within a chapter, each item is numbered consecutively. Example 1.51 is the fifty-first numbered item in chapter one.}


\subsubsection*{We will be learning and practicing to:}
%Define decision problem, Regular expressions
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Translate a decision problem to a set of strings coding the problem.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Distinguish between alphabet, language, sets, and strings}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Use regular expressions and relate them to languages and automata.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Write and debug regular expressions using correct syntax}
      \item {\bf Determine if a given string is in the language described by a regular expression}
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{TODO:}
\begin{list}{\itemsep-10pt}
   \item \#FinAid Assignment on Canvas (complete as soon as possible) and read syllabus on Canvas
   \item Schedule your Test 1 Attempt 1, Test 2 Attempt 1, Test 1 Attempt 2, and Test 2 Attempt 2 times 
   at PrairieTest (http://us.prairietest.com)
   \item Review Quiz 1 on PrairieLearn (http://us.prairielearn.com), complete by 1/15/25
   \item Create a homework group, possibly by using the Piazza (https://piazza.com/) find-a-teammate tool
   \item Homework 1 submitted via Gradescope (https://www.gradescope.com/), due 1/16/25
\end{list}
