    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use mapping reduction to deduce the complexity of a language by comparing to the complexity of another.
        \begin{itemize}
         \item {\bf Use appropriate reduction (e.g. mapping, Turing, polynomial-time) to deduce the complexity of a language by comparing to the complexity of another.}
         \item {\bf Use polynomial-time reduction to prove NP-completeness}
       \end{itemize}
    \item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is decidable or undecidable and recognizable or unrecognizable.

        \item {\bf Distinguish between computability and complexity}
        \item {\bf Articulate motivating questions of complexity}

{\bf Summary from Week 9}

Two models of computation are called {\bf equally expressive} when 
every language recognizable with the first model is recognizable with the second, and vice versa.

To prove the existence of a Turing machine that decides / recognizes some language, 
it's enough to construct an example using any of the equally expressive models.

But: some of the {\bf performance} properties of these models are not equivalent.
