{\it For Monday}: Definition 7.1 (page 276)

{\it For Wednesday}: Definition 7.7 (page 279)


\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is decidable or undecidable and recognizable or unrecognizable.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distinguish between computability and complexity
    \item Articulate motivating questions of complexity
    \item Define NP-completeness
    \item Give examples of PTIME-decidable, NPTIME-decidable, and NP-complete problems
\end{itemize}
\item Use mapping reduction to deduce the complexity of a language by comparing to the complexity of another.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Distinguish between computability and complexity
      \item Articulate motivating questions of complexity
      \item Use appropriate reduction (e.g. mapping, Turing, polynomial-time) to deduce the complexity of a language by comparing to the complexity of another.
      \item Use polynomial-time reduction to prove NP-completeness
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{TODO:}
\begin{list}
   {\itemsep2pt}
   \item Student Evaluations of Teaching forms: Evaluations are open for completion anytime BEFORE 8AM on Saturday, March 16.
    Access your SETs from the Evaluations site

    \end{quote}
    You will separately evaluate each of your listed instructors for each enrolled course. 

    **NEW** WINTER 2024 SET INCENTIVE LOTTERY: In Winter 2024, students who complete all of their student 
    evaluation forms for their undergraduate course will be entered into a lottery to win one of 
    5 \$100 Visa gift cards! To be entered into the lottery, students must complete at 
    least one instructor evaluation for EACH of their undergraduate courses. 
    They will be automatically entered when they have completed an instructor evaluation for 
    all of their undergraduate courses.

   \item Review quizzes based on class material each day; review quiz for Friday includes opportunity for feedback for course.
   \item Homework assignment 5 due Thursday.
\end{list}
