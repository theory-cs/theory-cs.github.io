\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is decidable or undecidable and recognizable or unrecognizable.
\begin{itemize}
   \item State, prove, and use theorems relating decidability, recognizability, and co-recognizability.
   \item Prove that a language is decidable or recognizable by defining and analyzing a Turing machines with appropriate properties.
\end{itemize}
\item Use diagonalization to prove that there are 'hard' languages relative to certain models of computation.
\item Use mapping reduction to deduce the complexity of a language by comparing to the complexity of another.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Define computable functions, and use them to give mapping reductions between computational problems
      \item Define and explain $A_{TM}$ and $HALT_{TM}$
      \item Build and analyze mapping reductions between computational problems
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
