\subsection*{Week 2 at a glance}

\vspace{-15pt}

\subsubsection*{Textbook reading: Sections 1.1, 1.2}

\vspace{-15pt}

Before Monday, read pages 41-43 (Figures 1.18, 1.19, 1.20) for examples of automata and languages.

Before Wednesday, read pages 48-50 (Figures 1.27, 1.29) which introduces nondeterminism.

Before Friday, read pages 45-46 (Theorem 1.25) that we'll refer to as a ``closure proof".

For Week 3 Monday: Theorem 1.47 + 1.48, Theorem 1.39 ``Proof Idea'', Example 1.41, Example 1.56.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf State the definition of the class of regular languages}
      \item {\bf Give examples of regular languages, using each of the three equivalent models of computation for proving regularity.}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Describe and use models of computation that don't involve state machines.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Given a DFA or NFA, find a regular expression that describes its language.}
      \item {\bf Given a regular expression, find a DFA or NFA that recognizes its language.}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of finite automata.
   \item Use clear English to describe computations of finite automata informally.

      \item {\bf Translate between a state diagram and a formal definition of a NFA}
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%\item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. Reason about computation and systems. Use mathematical techniques to solve problems. Determine appropriate conceptual tools to apply to new situations. Know when tools do not apply and try different approaches. Critically analyze and evaluate candidate solutions.
%\begin{itemize}
%   \item 
%\end{itemize}

% \item Understand, guide, shape impact of computing on society/the world. Connect the role of Theory CS classes to other applications (in undergraduate CS curriculum and beyond). Model problems using appropriate mathematical concepts.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Explain nondeterminism and describe tools for simulating it with deterministic computation.
%     \begin{itemize}
%       \item {\bf Given a nondeterministic finite automaton, find a deterministic finite automaton that recognizes its language.}

\subsection*{Wednesday: Nondeterministic automata}

We saw that whenever a language is recognized by a DFA, its
complement is also recognized by some (other) DFA. 

Another way to say this is that the collection of languages
that are each recognizable by a DFA is {\bf closed} under complementation.
