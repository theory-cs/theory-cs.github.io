\subsection*{Week 2 at a glance}

\vspace{-15pt}

\subsubsection*{Textbook reading: Sections 1.1, 1.2}

\vspace{-15pt}

Before Monday, read Figure 1.4 and Definition 1.5 (definition of finite automata) on pages 34-35.

Before Wednesday, read pages 41-43 (Figures 1.18, 1.19, 1.20) for examples of automata and languages. Wednesday's class will be asynchronous. Please read over the annotated notes and watch the relevant supplementary videos. Ask any followup questions in the discussion forum or in office hours.

Before Friday, read pages 48-50 (Figures 1.27, 1.29) which introduces nondeterminism.

No class on Week 3 Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

For Week 3 Wednesday: read the definition of the union, concatenation, and star operations for languages,  given 
as Definition 1.23 on page 44 and a useful example is Example 1.24.

\subsection*{Week 2 Friday: Nondeterministic automata}

We saw that whenever a language is recognized by a DFA, its
complement is also recognized by some (other) DFA. 

Another way to say this is that the collection of languages
that are each recognizable by a DFA is {\bf closed} under complementation.


Before we continue with more complicated constructions, let's revisit some of 
the assumption of the {\bf D}FA model.

Recall that the computation of {\bf deterministic} finite automaton has exactly one choice for its next step given the current state and the current character to read.
