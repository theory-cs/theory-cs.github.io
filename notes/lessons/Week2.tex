{\it Textbook references: Within a chapter, each item is numbered consecutively. Figure 1.22
is the twenty-second numbered item in chapter one; it comes right after Example 1.21 and right before Definition 1.23.}

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
DFA give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a DFA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of DFAs.

the languages recognized by DFAs.


Recall: Review quizzes based on class material are assigned each day. 
These quizzes will help you track and confirm your understanding of the concepts and examples 
we work in class. Quizzes can be submitted on Gradescope as many times (with no penalty) as 
you like until the quiz deadline: the three quizzes each week are all due on Friday (with no penalty 
late submission open until Sunday).
