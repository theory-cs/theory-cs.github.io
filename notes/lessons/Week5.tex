\subsubsection*{Textbook reading: Chapter 2}

{\it For Monday}: Introduction to Section 2.1 (page 102)

{\it For Wednesday}: Figure 3.1 (Pages 165-167)

{\it For Friday}: Test 1 is Friday Feb 9 in discussion section 4pm-4:50pm WLH 2001.  
The test covers material in Weeks 1 through 4 and Monday of Week 5.  To study for the exam, 
we recommend reviewing class notes (e.g. annotations linked on the class website, podcast, 
supplementary video from the class website), reviewing homework (and its posted sample solutions), 
and in particular *working examples* (extra examples in lecture notes, textbook examples listed in hw, 
review quizzes -- PDFs now available on the class website, discussion examples) and getting feedback (office hours and Piazza). 



\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is regular
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine whether a language is recognizable by a (D or N) FA and/or a PDA
    \end{itemize}
\item Use context-free grammars and relate them to languages and pushdown automata
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify the components of a formal definition of a context-free grammar (CFG)
        \item Use context-free grammars and relate them to languages and pushdown automata.
        \item Derive strings in the language of a given CFG
        \item Determine the language of a given CFG
        \item Design a CFG generating a given language
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{TODO:}
\begin{list}
   {\itemsep2pt}
   \item Review quizzes based on class material each day.
   \item Test this Friday in Discussion section.
   \item Homework assignment 3 due next Thursday.
\end{list}
