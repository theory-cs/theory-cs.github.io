\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describe and use models of computation that don't involve state machines.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\bf Use context-free grammars and relate them to languages and pushdown automata.}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of a Turing machine
        \item Use clear English to describe computations of Turing machines informally.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\bf Design a PDA that recognizes a given language.}
         \end{itemize}
       \item Give examples of sets that are context-free (and prove that they are).
       \begin{itemize}
          \item {\bf State the definition of the class of context-free languages}
          \item {\bf Explain the limits of the class of context-free languages}
          \item {\bf Identify some context-free sets and some non-context-free sets}
       \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. 
    Reason about computation and systems.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Describe and prove closure properties of classes of languages under certain operations.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\bf Apply a general construction to create a new PDA or CFG from an example one.}
            \item {\bf Formalize a general construction from an informal description of it.}
            \item {\bf Use general constructions to prove closure properties of the class of context-free langugages.}
            \item {\bf Use counterexamples to prove non-closure properties of the class of context-free langugages.}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
