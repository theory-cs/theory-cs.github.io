\section*{Let's get started}

We want you to be successful. 

We will work together to build an 
environment in CSE 105 that supports your learning
in a way that respects your
perspectives, experiences, and identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, 
class, sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).Â  
Our goal is for you to  engage
with interesting and challenging concepts and 
feel comfortable exploring, asking questions, and thriving.

If you or someone you know is suffering from food and/or housing insecurities 
there are UCSD resources here to help:

Basic Needs Office: \href{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}{https://basicneeds.ucsd.edu/}

Triton Food Pantry (in the old Student Center)
is free and anonymous, and includes produce: 

\href{https://www.facebook.com/tritonfoodpantry/}{https://www.facebook.com/tritonfoodpantry/}

Mutual Aid UCSD: \href{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}{https://mutualaiducsd.wordpress.com/}

Financial aid resources, the possibility of emergency grant funding, and off-campus housing referral 
resources are available: see your College Dean of Student Affairs.

If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, ask for help. 
We are committed to upholding University policies regarding nondiscrimination, sexual violence and sexual harassment.
Here are some campus contacts that could provide this help: 
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) at 858 534-3755 or \href{http://caps.ucsd.edu}{http://caps.ucsd.edu}; 
OPHD at 858 534-8298 or ophd@ucsd.edu , \href{http://ophd.ucsd.edu}{http://ophd.ucsd.edu};
CARE at Sexual Assault Resource Center at 858 534-5793 or sarc@ucsd.edu , \href{http://care.ucsd.edu}{http://care.ucsd.edu}.


Please reach out (minnes@ucsd.edu) if you need support with extenuating circumstances affecting CSE 105.

On a typical week: {\bf MWF} Lectures + review quizzes, {\bf Tu} Homework due, {\bf WF} Discussion.
Office hours (hosted by instructors and TAs and tutors, where you can come to talk 
about course concepts and ask for help as you work through sample problems) and Q+A on Piazza available throughout the week.
All dates are on \href{https://canvas.ucsd.edu/}{Canvas (click for link)} and details are on
 \href{https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/51649/}{the Syllabus page}.


There are lots of great reasons to have a laptop, tablet, or phone open during class. You might be taking notes, 
getting a photo of an important moment on the board, trying out a construction that we're developing together, working 
on the review quiz, and so on. 
The main issue with screens and technology in the classroom isn't your own distraction (which is your responsibility to manage), 
it's the distraction of other students. Anyone sitting behind you cannot help but have your screen in their field of view. 
Having distracting content on your screen can really harm their learning experience.

With this in mind, the device policy for the course is that if you have a screen open, you either:

Have only content onscreen that's directly related to the current lecture.
Have unrelated content open and sit in one of the back two rows of the room to mitigate the effects on other students.

Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Winter 2024!

\section*{CSE 105's Big Questions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What problems are computers capable of solving?
   \item What resources are needed to solve a problem?
   \item Are some problems harder than others?
\end{itemize}

In this context, a {\bf problem} is defined as: ``Making a decision or computing a value based on some input"

Consider the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Find a file on your computer
   \item Determine if your code will compile
   \item Find a run-time error in your code
   \item Certify that your system is un-hackable
\end{itemize}

Which of these is hardest?

\vfill

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.

To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
{\bf Finite automata} give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a FA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of these finite automata.
