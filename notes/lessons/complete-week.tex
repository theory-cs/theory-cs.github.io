Welcome to CSE 105: Introduction to Theory of Computation in Winter 2025!

\section*{CSE 105's Big Questions}
\begin{itemize}
   \item What problems are computers capable of solving?
   \item What resources are needed to solve a problem?
   \item Are some problems harder than others?
\end{itemize}

In this context, a {\bf problem} is defined as: ``Making a decision or computing a value based on some input"

Consider the following problems: 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Find a file on your computer
   \item Determine if your code will compile
   \item Find a run-time error in your code
   \item Certify that your system is un-hackable
\end{itemize}

Which of these is hardest?

\vfill

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.

To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

\subsection*{Week 2 Friday: Nondeterministic automata}

We saw that whenever a language is recognized by a DFA, its
complement is also recognized by some (other) DFA. 

Another way to say this is that the collection of languages
that are each recognizable by a DFA is {\bf closed} under complementation.


Before we continue with more complicated constructions, let's revisit some of 
the assumption of the {\bf D}FA model.

Recall that the computation of {\bf deterministic} finite automaton has exactly one choice for its next step given the current state and the current character to read.

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
{\bf Finite automata} give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a FA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of these finite automata.
