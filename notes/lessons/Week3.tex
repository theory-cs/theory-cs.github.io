%Define decision problem, Formal definition of automata, Informal definition of automata, Find example languages, 
%Describe and use models of computation that don't involve state machines.
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
\begin{itemize}
   \item Give examples of sets that are regular (and prove that they are).
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf State the definition of the class of regular languages}
      \item {\bf Give examples of regular languages, using each of the three equivalent models of computation for proving regularity.}
      \item {\bf Choose between multiple models to prove that a language is regular}
      \item {\bf Explain the limits of the class of regular languages}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Describe and use models of computation that don't involve state machines.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf Given a DFA or NFA, find a regular expression that describes its language.}
      \item {\bf Given a regular expression, find a DFA or NFA that recognizes its language.}

\end{itemize}

\item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply classical techniques including pumping lemma, determinization, diagonalization, and reduction to analyze the complexity of languages and problems.

    \item {\bf Use the pumping lemma to prove that a given language is not regular.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Understand, guide, shape impact of computing on society/the world. Connect the role of Theory CS classes to other applications (in undergraduate CS curriculum and beyond). Model problems using appropriate mathematical concepts.
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Explain nondeterminism and describe tools for simulating it with deterministic computation.
     \begin{itemize}
       \item {\bf Given a NFA, find a DFA that recognizes its language.}

\newpage

In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
{\bf Finite automata} give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a FA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of these finite automata.
