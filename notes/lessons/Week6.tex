\subsubsection*{Make sure you can:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use and design automata both formally and informally, including DFA, NFA, PDA, TM.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use precise notation to formally define the state diagram of DFA, NFA, PDA, TM.
        \item Use clear English to describe computations of DFA, NFA, PDA, TM informally
        \item Determine whether a language is recognizable by a (D or N) FA and/or a PDA
        \item Motivate the definition of a Turing machine
        \item Trace the computation of a Turing machine on given input
        \item Describe the language recognized by a Turing machine
        \item Determine if a Turing machine is a decider
        \item Given an implementation-level description of a Turing machine
        \item Use high-level descriptions to define and trace Turing machines
        \item Apply dovetailing in high-level definitions of machines
        \item State and use the Church-Turing thesis
    \end{itemize}
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is regular, context-free, decidable, or recognizable.
\item Give examples of sets that are regular, context-free, decidable, or recognizable.
\end{itemize}
