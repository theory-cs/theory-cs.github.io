\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly and unambiguously communicate computational ideas using appropriate formalism. Translate across levels of abstraction.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Give examples of sets that are regular, context-free, decidable, or recognizable (and prove that they are).
        \begin{itemize}
          \item {\bf Define and explain computational problems, including $A_{**}$, $E_{**}$, $EQ_{**}$, (for **  DFA or TM) and $HALT_{TM}$}
       \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Know, select and apply appropriate computing knowledge and problem-solving techniques. Reason about computation and systems.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use mapping reduction to deduce the complexity of a language by comparing to the complexity of another.
           \begin{itemize}
              \item {\bf Explain what it means for one problem to reduce to another}
              \item {\bf Define computable functions, and use them to give mapping reductions between computational problems}
              \item {\bf Build and analyze mapping reductions between computational problems}
           \end{itemize}
    \item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is regular, context-free, decidable, or recognizable.
    \begin{itemize}
         \item {\bf State, prove, and use theorems relating decidability, recognizability, and co-recognizability.}
         \item {\bf Prove that a language is decidable or recognizable by defining and analyzing a Turing machines with appropriate properties.}

   \end{itemize}
   \item  Describe several variants of Turing machines and informally explain why they are equally expressive.
   \begin{itemize}
   \item {\bf Define an enumerator}
   \item {\bf Define nondeterministic Turing machines}
   \item {\bf Use high-level descriptions to define and trace machines (Turing machines and enumerators)}
   \item {\bf Apply dovetailing in high-level definitions of machines}
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
