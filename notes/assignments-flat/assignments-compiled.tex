\newcommand{\instructions}{{\bf For all HW assignments:} Weekly homework 
may be done individually or in groups of up to 3 students. 
You may switch HW partners for different HW assignments. 
Please ensure your name(s) and PID(s) are clearly visible on the first page of your homework submission 
and then upload the PDF to Gradescope. If working in a group, submit only one submission per group: 
one partner uploads the submission through their Gradescope account and then adds the other group member(s) 
to the Gradescope submission by selecting their name(s) in the ``Add Group Members" dialog box. 
You will need to re-add your group member(s) every time you resubmit a new version of your assignment.
 Each homework question will be graded either for correctness (including clear and precise explanations and 
 justifications of all answers) or fair effort completeness. 
 On the ``graded for correctness"
 questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group; if your
 group has questions about a problem, you may ask in drop-in help hours or post a private
post (visible only to the Instructors) on Piazza. On the "graded for completeness" questions, you 
may collaborate with all other CSE 105 students this quarter, and you may make public posts about these questions 
on Piazza.

All submitted homework for this class must be typed. 
You can use a word processing editor if you like (Microsoft Word, Open Office, Notepad, Vim, Google Docs, etc.) 
but you might find it useful to take this opportunity to learn LaTeX. 
LaTeX is a markup language used widely in computer science and mathematics. 
The homework assignments are typed using LaTeX and you can use the source files 
as templates for typesetting your solutions.
To generate state diagrams of machines, you can (1) use the LaTex tikzpicture
environment (see templates in the class notes), or (2) use the software tools Flap.js or
JFLAP described in the class syllabus (and include a screenshot in your PDF), or (3) you can carefully
and clearly hand-draw
the diagram and take a picture and include it in your PDF.
We recommend that you
submit early drafts to Gradescope so that in case of any technical difficulties, at least some of your
work is present. You may update your submission as many times as you'd like up to the deadline.


{\bf Integrity reminders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problems should be solved together, not divided up between the partners. The homework is
designed to give you practice with the main concepts and techniques of the course, 
while getting to know and learn from your classmates.
\item On the ``graded for correctness"
questions, you may only collaborate with CSE 105 students in your group.
You may ask questions about the homework in office hours (of the instructor, TAs, and/or tutors) and 
on Piazza (as private notes viewable only to the Instructors).  
You \emph{cannot} use any online resources about the course content other than the class material 
from this quarter -- this is primarily to ensure that we all use consistent notation and
definitions (aligned with the textbook) and also to protect the learning experience you will have when
the `aha' moments of solving the problem authentically happen.
\item Do not share written solutions or partial solutions for homework with 
other students in the class who are not in your group. Doing so would dilute their learning 
experience and detract from their success in the class.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Assigned questions}


\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
\item\textbf{Strings and languages: finding examples and edge cases} (12 points):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst  Give five (different) example alphabets that are meaningful or useful to you in some way. Specify them formally, either with 
    roster notation (which means listing all and only distict elements between $\{$ and $\}$ and separated by commas) or with another approach to precisely define all and only the elements of the alphabet.

    \item\gradeComplete Give an example of a finite set over an alphabet  and an infinite set over an alphabet. You get to choose the alphabet, and you get to choose the sets.  The goal is to practice communicating your choices and definitions with clear and precise notation. One habit that will be useful (for this course, and beyond), is to think of your response for each question as a well-formed paragraph: include all the information that is relevant so that your solution is self-contained, and so that each sentence is grammatically constructed.
    
    \item\gradeCorrectFirst Define an alphabet $\Sigma_1$ and an alphabet $\Sigma_2$ and a language $L_1$ over $\Sigma_1$ that is also a language over $\Sigma_2$ and a language $L_2$ over $\Sigma_2$ that is {\bf not} a language over $\Sigma_1$. 
    A complete and correct answer will use clear and precise notation
    (consistent with the textbook and class notes) and will include a description of why the given example $L_1$
    is a language over both $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ and a description 
    of why the given example $L_2$ is a language over $\Sigma_2$ and not over $\Sigma_1$.

    \end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{Regular expressions} (20 points):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete  Give three regular expressions that all describe the set of all strings over $\{a,b\}$ that have 
    odd length. Ungraded bonus challenge: Make the expressions as different as possible!

    \item\gradeComplete  A friend tells you that each regular expression that has a Kleene star ($~^*$) describes an
    infinite language. Are they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a counterexample to disprove it
    and explain your counterexample.

    \item\gradeCorrect For this question, the alphabet is $\{a,b,c\}$. A friend is trying to design a regular expression that describes the set of all strings over this alphabet that end in $c$. Classify each of the following attempts as 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Correct. Explain why.
    \item Error Type 1: Incorrect, because (even though each string that is in the language described by the regular expression ends in $c$) there is a string that ends in $c$ that is not in the language described by the regular expression. Give this example string and explain why it proves we're in this case. 
    \item Error Type 2: Incorrect, because (even though each string that ends in $c$ is in the language described by the regular expression), there is a string in the language described by the regular expression that does not end in $c$. Give this example string and explain why it proves we're in this case. 
    \item Error Type 3: Incorrect, because there are two counterexample strings, one which is a string that ends in $c$ that is not in the language described by the regular expression and one which is in the language described by the regular expression but does not end in $c$.Give both example strings and describe why each has the given property.
    \end{itemize}

    \vfill
    \newpage

    \hrule
    {\it Worked example for reference:} Consider the regular expression $(a\cup b\cup c)^*$. This regular expression has {\bf Error Type 2} because it describes the set of all strings over $\{a,b,c\}$, so even though each string that ends in $c$ is in this language, there is an example, say $ab$ that is a string in the language described by the regular expression (because we consider the string formed as a result of the Kleene star operation which has 2 slots and where the first slot matches the $a$ in $a \cup b \cup c$ and the second slot matches $b$ in $a \cup b \cup c$) but does not end in $c$ (it ends in $b$).
    \hrule
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The regular expression is   
        \[
        (a\cup b)^* \circ c
        \]
        \item The regular expression is  
        \[
        (a \circ b \circ c)^*
        \]
        \item The regular expression is  
        \[
        a^*c ~\cup~ b^*c ~\cup~ c^*c
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{Functions over languages} (18 points):

For each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]
Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for any sets $X$ and $Y$
\[
X \cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}
\]
\[
X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y \}
\]

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Specify an example language $A$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$SUBSTRING(A) = EXTEND(A)$$
    or explain why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $A$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $SUBSTRING(A)$, $EXTEND(A)$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set equality,
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example language $B$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$SUBSTRING(B) \cap EXTEND(B) = \{\varepsilon\}$$ and $$SUBSTRING(B) \cup EXTEND(B) = \{0,1\}^*$$
    or explain why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $B$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $SUBSTRING(B)$, $EXTEND(B)$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set equality with 
    $\{\varepsilon\}$ and $\{0,1\}^*$ (respectively), or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example {\bf infinite} language $C$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$SUBSTRING(C) \neq \{0,1\}^*$$ and $$SUBSTRING(C) = C^*$$or 
    explain why there is no such example.
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $C$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $SUBSTRING(C)$, $C^*$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims, 
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.


    \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example {\bf finite} language $D$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$EXTEND(D) \neq \{0,1\}^*$$ and $$EXTEND(D) = D^*$$or 
    explain why there is no such example.
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $D$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $EXTEND(D)$, $D^*$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims, 
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

{\bf Assigned questions}
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
\item\textbf{Finite automata} (10 points):
Consider the finite automaton $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ whose state diagram is depicted below
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
\tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=none]

\node[initial,state] (q0)          {$q_0$};

    (q3) edge [loop right] node {$a,b$} (q3)
    (q4) edge [loop right] node{$a,b$} (q4)
;
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst Write the formal definition of this automaton. In other words, give the five defining parameters $Q$, $\Sigma$, $\delta$, $q_0$, $F$ so that they are consistent with the state diagram of $M$.

    \item\gradeCorrectFirst Give a regular expression $R$ so that $L(R) = L(M)$. In other words, we want a regular expression that describes the language 
    recognized by this finite automaton. Justify your answer by referring to the 
    definition of the semantics of regular expressions and computations of finite automata. 
    Include an explanation for why each string in $L(R)$ is accepted by the finite automaton {\it and}
    for why each string not in $L(R)$ is rejected by the finite automaton.

    {\it Ungraded bonus: can you find more than one such regular expression?}

    \item\gradeComplete Keeping the same set of states $Q$, 
    input alphabet $\Sigma$, 
    same start state $q_0$, and same transition 
    function $\delta$, choose a new set of accepting states $F_{new1}$ so that the new 
    finite automaton $M_1 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_{new1})$ that results 
    recognizes a {\bf proper superset} of $L(M)$, or explain 
    why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your choice of $F_{new1}$
    {\it and} a precise and clear explanation of why every string that is accepted by 
    $M$ is also accepted by $M_1$ {\it and} an example of a string that is accepted by $M_1$ and is rejected by $M$; or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.


    \item\gradeCorrect Keeping the same set of states $Q$, 
    input alphabet $\Sigma$, 
    same start state $q_0$, and same transition 
    function $\delta$, choose a new set of accepting states $F_{new2}$ so that the new 
    finite automaton $M_2 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_{new2})$ that results 
    recognizes a {\bf nonempty proper subset} of $L(M)$, or explain 
    why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your choice of $F_{new2}$
    {\it and} an example string accepted by $M_2$ {\it and} a precise and clear explanation of why every string that is accepted by 
    $M_2$ is also accepted by $M$ {\it and} an example of a string that is accepted by $M$ and is rejected by $M_2$; or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Automata design} (12 points):
As background to this question, recall that integers can be represented using base $b$ expansions, for 
any convenient choice of base $b$. The precise definition is:
for $b$ an integer greater than $1$ and $n$ a positive integer, 
the {\bf base $b$ expansion of $n$}  is defined to be
\[
(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b
\]
where $k$ is a positive integer, $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}$ 
are nonnegative integers less than $b$, $a_{k-1} \neq  0$, and
\[
n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}
\]

Notice: {\it The base $b$ expansion of a positive integer $n$ is a string over the alphabet 
$\{x \in \mathbb{Z} \st 0 \leq x < b\}$
whose leftmost character is nonzero.}

An important property of base $b$ expansions of integers is that, for each integer $b$ greater than $1$,
each positive integer $n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b$, and each nonnegative integer $a$ less than $b$, 
\[
    bn + a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b
\]
In other words, shifting the base $b$ expansion to the left results in multiplying the integer value by the base.
In this question we'll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize 
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Design a DFA that recognizes the set of binary (base $2$) expansions of 
    positive integers that are powers of $2$. A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

    {\it Hints}: (1) A power of $2$ is an integer $x$ that can be written as $2^y$ for some nonnegative integer $y$, 
    (2) the DFA should accept the strings $100$, $10$ and $100000$ and should reject the 
    strings $010$, $1101$, and $\varepsilon$ (can you see why?).

    \item\gradeCorrect Design a DFA that recognizes the set of 
    binary (base $2$) expansions of positive integers that are less than $10$. Your DFA must use {\bf fewer than ten states}. 
    A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

    \item \gradeComplete Find a positive integer $B$ greater than $1$ so that 
    there is a DFA that recognizes the set of 
    base $B$ expansions of positive integers that are less than $10$ and it 
    uses as few states as possible. A complete solution will include the state 
    diagram of your DFA and 
    a brief justification of your choice of base.
        

    {\it Hint: sometimes rewriting the defining membership condition for a set in different ways helps us find alternate representations of that set.}
    \end{enumerate}


\item \textbf{Nondeterminism} (15 points): For this question, the alphabet is $\{a,b,c\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeComplete Design a NFA that recognizes the language
    \[ 
    L_1 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w \text{ starts with $a$ {\bf and} ends with $a$}\}
    \]

    A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction that explains the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

\item\gradeCorrect Design a NFA that recognizes the language 
    \[ 
    L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w \text{ has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
    \]
    For example, the empty string, $a$, $bac$, and $abca$ are each elements of this language but $aa$ and $abb$ and $abbc$ are not elements of this language.

    A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction that explains the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

\item\gradeComplete Consider the language
\begin{align*}
L_1 \cup L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w &\text{ starts with $a$ and ends with $a$} \\
&\text{{\bf or} has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
\end{align*}
Give at least two representations of this language among the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A regular expression that describes $L_1 \cup L_2$
\item A DFA that recognizes $L_1 \cup L_2$
\item A NFA that recognizes $L_1 \cup L_2$
\end{itemize}

You can design your automata directly or use the constructions from class and chapter 1 in the book to build these automata from automata for the simpler languages.
    
A complete solution will include at least two of the representations
as well as  a brief justification of each construction.


\item\gradeComplete Consider the language
    \begin{align*}
    L_1 \cap L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w &\text{ starts with $a$ and ends with $a$} \\
    &\text{{\bf and} has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
    \end{align*}
    Give at least two representations of this language among the following: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A regular expression that describes $L_1 \cap L_2$
    \item A DFA that recognizes $L_1 \cap L_2$
    \item A NFA that recognizes $L_1 \cap L_2$
    \end{itemize}
    You can design your automata directly or use the constructions from class and chapter 1 in the book to build these automata from automata for the simpler languages.
    
A complete solution will include at least two of the representations
as well as  a brief justification of each construction.

\end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{General constructions} (13 points):
In this question, you'll practice working with formal general constructions
for automata and translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.


Recall the definitions of operations we've talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, 
we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]
Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for any sets $X$ and $Y$
\[
X \cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}
\]
\[
X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y \}
\]


Let $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and 
$M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)$ be DFA.

For simplicity, assume that $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$ and that 
$q_0 \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2$.

Consider the following definitions of new automata parameterized by 
these DFA:
\begin{itemize}
\item The NFA $N_\alpha = ( Q_1 \cup Q_2 \cup \{q_0\}, \Sigma, \delta_\alpha, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)$ with the transition function given by 
\[
\delta_\alpha ( ~(q,x)~) = \begin{cases}
\{q_1, q_2\} &\text{if $q = q_0$, $x = \varepsilon$} \\
\emptyset &\text{if $q=q_0$, $x\in \Sigma$}\\
\{\delta_{1}(~(q,x)~)\} &\text{if $q\in Q_1$, $x\in \Sigma$}\\
\{\delta_{2}(~(q,x)~)\} &\text{if $q\in Q_2$, $x\in \Sigma$}\\
\emptyset &\text{if $q \in Q_1 \cup Q_2$, $x = \varepsilon$} \\
\end{cases}
\]
\item The NFA $N_\beta = ( Q_1 \times Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_\beta, (q_1,q_2), F_1 \times F_2)$  with the transition function given by 
\[
\delta_\beta(~(~(r,s)~, x~)~) = \{ (~\delta_{1}(~(r,x)~), \delta_{2}( ~(s,x)~)~)\}
\]
 and 
\[
\delta_\beta(~(~(r,s)~, \varepsilon~)~) = \emptyset
\]
for $r \in Q_1, s \in Q_2, x \in \Sigma$.
\item The NFA $N_{\gamma}=(Q_1\cup\{q_{0}\},\Sigma,\delta_{\gamma},q_{0},\{q \in Q_1 \mid \exists w \in \Sigma^* (\delta_1^* ((q,w)) \in F_1)\})$, and
        \[
            \delta_{\gamma} ((q,a)) = \begin{cases}
                \{\delta_1((q,a))\} &\text{if $q \in Q_1$, $a \in \Sigma$} \\
                \{q' \in Q_1 \mid \exists w \in \Sigma^* (\delta_1^*((q_1,w)) = q') \}&\text{if $q =q_{0}$, $a = \varepsilon$}\\
                \emptyset &\text{if $q = q_{0}$, $a \in \Sigma$} \\
                \emptyset &\text{if $q \in Q_1$, $a = \varepsilon$}
            \end{cases}
        \]

{\it Hint: the notation $\delta_1^*$ refers to the iterated transition function.}

\item\gradeCorrect 
Illustrate the construction of $N_{\alpha}$ by defining a specific pair 
of example DFAs $M_1$ and $M_2$ and applying the

A complete solution will consider each of the constructions $N_\alpha, N_\beta, N_\gamma$ in turn, and for each, either name the operation that's associated with the construction (and explain why) or explain why none of the operations mentioned is associated with the construction.

{\bf Assigned questions}
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]



\item \textbf{Static analysis} (10 points):
In software engineering, static analysis is an approach to debugging and testing where the properties of a piece of code are inferred without actually running it.  
In the context of finite automata, we can think of static analysis as the process of inferring properties of the language recognized by 
a finite automaton from properties of the graph underlying its state diagram. The Pumping Lemma is one example of static analysis.
In this question, you'll explore other examples of how properties of the 
graph underlying the state diagram of a machine can give us information about 
the language recognized by the machine.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeCompleteFirst Suppose you are given an NFA $N_0$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ and each accepting state in $N_0$ is not reachable from the start state of $N_0$.  What can you conclude about the language of the NFA?

\item\gradeCorrectFirst Prove or disprove: For any alphabet $\Sigma$ and any  DFA $M$ over $\Sigma$, if every state in $M$ is accepting then $L(M) = \Sigma^*$. A complete answer will clearly indicate whether the statement is true or false and then will justify with a complete and correct argument.

\item\gradeCorrect Prove or disprove: For any alphabet $\Sigma$ and any  NFA $N$ over $\Sigma$, if every state in $N$ is accepting then $L(N) = \Sigma^*$. A complete answer will clearly indicate whether the statement is true or false and then will justify with a complete and correct argument.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Multiple representations} (12 points):

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Consider the language $A_1 = \{ uw \mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}$
   and the following argument.

   \begin{quote}
      ``Proof" that $A_1$ is not regular using the Pumping Lemma: Let $p$ be 
      an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_1$. 
      
      Choose $s$ to be the string $1^p 0^p$, which is in $A_1$ because
      we can choose $u = 1^p$ and $w = 0^p$ which each have length $p$.
      Since $s$ is in $A_1$ and has length greater than or equal to $p$, if $p$ were to be a
      pumping length for $A_1$, $s$ ought to be pump'able. 
      That is, there should be a way of dividing $s$ into parts $x,y,z$ where $s=xyz$,
      $|y| >0$, $|xy| \leq p$, and for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A_1$.
      Suppose $x,y,z$ are such that $s = xyz$, $|y| > 0$ and $|xy| \leq p$.
      Since the first $p$ letters of $s$ are all $1$ and $|xy| \leq p$, we know
      that $x$ and $y$ are made up of all $1$s.  If we let $i=2$, we get 
      a string $xy^iz$ that is not in $A_1$ because repeating $y$ twice adds $1$s to 
      $u$ but not to $w$, and strings in $A_1$ are required to have $u$ and $w$ be the same
      length. Thus, $s$ is not pumpable (even though it should have been if $p$ were to be a pumping length)
      and so $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_1$.  Since $p$ was arbitrary, we have
      demonstrated that $A_1$ has no pumping length.  By the Pumping Lemma, this implies that 
      $A_1$ is nonregular.
      \end{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \gradeComplete Find the (first and/or most significant) logical error in the ``proof" above 
         and describe why it's wrong.
   
         \item \gradeComplete Prove that the set $A_1$ is actually regular (by finding a regular expression that describes it or 
         a DFA/NFA that recognizes it, and justifying why) {\bf or} fix the proof so that it is logically sound.     
      \end{enumerate}

   \item Consider the language $A_2 = \{ u1w \mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}$
   and the following argument.


   \begin{quote}
      ``Proof" that $A_2$ is not regular using the Pumping Lemma: Let $p$ be 
      an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_2$. 
      
      Choose $s$ to be the string $1^{p+1} 0^{p}$, which is in $A_2$ because
      we can choose $u = 1^p$ and $w = 0^p$ which each have length $p$.
      Since $s$ is in $A_2$ and has length greater than or equal to $p$, if $p$ were to be a
      pumping length for $A_2$, $s$ ought to be pump'able. 
      That is, there should be a way of dividing $s$ into parts $x,y,z$ where $s=xyz$,
      $|y| >0$, $|xy| \leq p$, and for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A_2$.
      When $x = \varepsilon$ and $y = 1^{p+1}$ and $z = 0^{p}$,
      we have satisfied that $s = xyz$, $|y| > 0$ (because $p$ is positive) and $|xy| \leq p$.
      If we let $i=0$, we get 
      the string $xy^iz = 0^{p}$ that is not in $A_2$ because its middle symbol is a $0$, not a $1$. 
      Thus, $s$ is not pumpable (even though it should have been if $p$ were to be a pumping length)
      and so $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_2$.  Since $p$ was arbitrary, we have
      demonstrated that $A_2$ has no pumping length.  By the Pumping Lemma, this implies that 
      $A_2$ is nonregular.
      \end{quote}

      \begin{enumerate}

      \item \gradeComplete Find the (first and/or most significant) logical error in the ``proof" above 
      and describe why it's wrong.

      \item \gradeComplete Prove that the set $A_2$ is actually regular (by finding a regular expression that describes it or 
      a DFA/NFA that recognizes it, and justifying why) {\bf or} fix the proof so that it is logically sound.
      
      \end{enumerate}
   
\end{enumerate}


\item \textbf{Pumping} (10 points):

\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeCorrect Give an example of a language
over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$ that has cardinality $3$ and for which $5$ is a pumping length
and $4$ is not a pumping length. Is this language regular? A complete solution will give 
(1) a clear and precise
description of the language, (2) a justification for why $5$ is a pumping length, (3) a 
justification for why $4$ is not a pumping length, (4) a correct and justified answer to 
whether the language is regular.


\item\gradeComplete In class and in the reading so far, we've seen the following examples of nonregular sets:
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{center}
$\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 0 \}$
$$\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 2 \}$$
$$\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~  0 \leq n \leq m \}$$
$$\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~ 0 \leq m \leq n \}$$
$$\{ 0^i 1^{2i} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}$$
$$\{ 0^i 1^{i+1} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}$$
$$\{ 0^n 1^m 0^n ~|~n,m \geq 0\}$$
$$\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* ~|~w = w^{\mathcal{R}}\}$$
$$\{ w w^{\mathcal{R}} ~|~ w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$$
\end{center}
\end{multicols}
Modify one of these sets in some way and use the Pumping Lemma to prove that the resulting set is still nonregular.

\end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{Regular and nonregular languages} (12 points):
In Week 2's review quiz, we saw the definition that a set $X$ is said to be 
{\bf closed under an operation} if, for any elements in
$X$, applying to them gives an element in $X$. For example, the set of
integers is closed under multiplication because if we take any two
integers, their product is also an integer .

Recall the definitions of operations we've talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, 
we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]
Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for any sets $X$ and $Y$
\[
X \cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}
\]
\[
X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y \}
\]

\begin{enumerate} 
   \item \gradeCorrect Use the general constructions that we developed
   to prove the closure of the class of regular languages under various operations to produce the state diagram of a NFA that recognizes the language
   \[
   (~SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})~)^*
   \]
   {\it Hint: Question 4 from Homework 2 might be helpful.}
   
    For full credit, submit (1) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes $\{0,01,111\}$, (2) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes $SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})$, and (3) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes $(~SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})~)^*$, and a brief justification of each state diagram that 
    references the language being recognized or the general constructions being used.

   \item \gradeComplete Prove that the class of nonregular languages over $\{0,1\}$ is not closed under the $SUBSTRING$ operation by giving an example 
   language $A$ that is nonregular but for which $SUBSTRING(A)$ is regular.
   A complete solution will give 
   (1) a clear and precise
   description of the language, (2) a justification for why it is nonregular (either by proving this directly or by referring to specific examples from the class or textbook), (3) a description of the result of applying the 
   $SUBSTRING$ operation to the language, and  (4) a justification for
   why this resulting language is regular.

   \item  \gradeCorrect Prove that the class of nonregular languages over $\{0,1\}$ is not closed under the $EXTEND$ operation by giving an example 
   language $B$ that is nonregular but for which $EXTEND(B)$ is regular.
   A complete solution will give 
   (1) a clear and precise
   description of the language, (2) a justification for why it is nonregular (either by proving this directly or by referring to specific examples from the class or textbook), (3) a description of the result of applying the 
   $EXTEND$ operation to the language, and  (4) a justification for
   why this resulting language is regular.

   \item \gradeComplete   Prove that the class of nonregular languages over $\{0,1\}$ is not closed under the Kleene star operation by giving an example 
   language $C$ that is nonregular but for which $C^*$ is regular.
   A complete solution will give 
   (1) a clear and precise
   description of the language, (2) a justification for why it is nonregular (either by proving this directly or by referring to specific examples from the class or textbook), (3) a description of the result of applying the 
   Kleene star operation to the language, and  (4) a justification for
   why this resulting language is regular.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Regular and nonregular languages and Push-down automata (PDA)} (6 points): 
On page 7 of the week 4 notes, we have the following list of languages over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\{a^nb^n \mid 0  \leq n  \leq 5 \}$
    &$\{b^n a^n \mid  n  \geq 2\}$
    &$\{a^m b^n \mid  0 \leq m\leq n\}$
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
    $\{a^m b^n \mid  m \geq n+3,  n \geq 0\}$
    &$\{b^m a^n \mid  m \geq 1, n \geq  3\}$\\
    $\{ w  \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w = w^\mathcal{R} \}$
    &$\{ ww^\mathcal{R} \mid w\in \{a,b\}^* \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Pick one of the regular languages and design a regular expression that describes it and a DFA that recognizes it. 
    Briefly justify your regular expression by connecting
    the subexpressions of it to the intended language and referencing relevant definitions. Briefly justify your DFA design by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, 
    as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.
    \item\gradeComplete Pick one of the nonregular languages and design a PDA that recognizes it. Draw the state diagram of 
    your PDA. Briefly justify your design by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, 
    as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

\item \textbf{Regular and nonregular languages and context-free grammars (CFG)} (6 points): 
On page 7 of the week 4 notes, we have the following list of languages over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\{a^nb^n \mid 0  \leq n  \leq 5 \}$
    &$\{b^n a^n \mid  n  \geq 2\}$
    &$\{a^m b^n \mid  0 \leq m\leq n\}$

    &$\{b^m a^n \mid  m \geq 1, n \geq  3\}$\\

    &$\{ ww^\mathcal{R} \mid w\in \{a,b\}^* \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst Pick one of the regular languages and design a context-free grammar that generates it. 
    Briefly justify your grammar by describing the role of each of the rules
    and connecting it to the intended language and referencing relevant definitions.
    \item\gradeComplete Pick one of the nonregular languages and design a context-free grammar that generates it.  Briefly justify your grammar by describing the role of each of the rules
    and connecting it to the intended language and referencing relevant definitions.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{General constructions for context-free languages} (15 points):

In class in week 5, we described several general constructions 
with PDAs and CFGs, leaving their details to
homework. In this question, we'll fill in these details. The first constructions
help us prove that the class of regular languages is a subset of the
class of context-free languages. The other construction allows us 
to make simplifying assumptions about PDAs recognizing languages.

\begin{enumerate}

\item\gradeComplete When we first introduced PDAs we observed 
that any NFA can be transformed to a PDA by not using the stack 
of the PDA at all. Suppose a friend gives you the following construction
to formalize this transformation:

\begin{quote}
Given a NFA $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta_N, q_0, F)$ we define a PDA $M$
with $L(M) = L(N)$ by letting $M = ( Q, \Sigma, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where 
$\delta(~(q,a,b)~) = \delta_N(~(q,a)~)$ for each $q \in Q$, 
$a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$ and $b \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$.
\end{quote}

For each of the six defining parameters for the PDA, explain whether 
it's defined correctly or not. If it is not defined correctly, 
explain why not and give a new definition for this parameter that 
corrects the mistake.

\item\gradeCorrectFirst In the book on page 107, the top paragraph describes a procedure for converting DFAs to CFGs:
\begin{quote}
   You can convert any DFA into an equivalent CFG as follows. 
   Make a variable $R_i$ for each state $q_i$ of the DFA. Add the rule $R_i \to aR_j$ to the
   CFG if $\delta(q_i,a) =q_j$ is a transition in the DFA. Add the rule
   $R_i\to \varepsilon$ if $q_i$ is an accept state of the DFA. Make $R_0$ the start variable ofthe grammar, 
   where $q_0$ is the start state of the machine. Verify on your own that the resulting CFG 
   generates the same language that the DFA recognizes.
\end{quote}

Use this construction to get a context-free grammar generating the language 
\[
    \{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w \text{ has at least one $a$ and does not end in  $bb$}\}
\]
by (1) designing a DFA that recognizes this language and then (2) applying the construction from the book to convert the 
DFA to an equivalent CFG. A complete and correct submission will include the state diagram of the DFA, a brief justification of why 
it recognizes the language, and then the complete and precise definition of the CFG that results from applying the construction 
from the book to this DFA. {\it Ungraded bonus: take a sample string in the language and see how the computation of 
the DFA on this string translates to a derivation in your grammar.}

\item Let $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ 
be a PDA and let $q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}$ be three fresh state labels 
(i.e. $Q_1 \cap \{q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}\} = \emptyset$) 
and let $\#$ be a fresh stack symbol (i.e. $\# \notin \Gamma_1$).
We define the PDA $M_2$ as
\[
   (Q_2, \Sigma, \Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_{new}, \{s_{new}\})
\]
with $Q_2 = Q_1 \cup \{q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}\}$ 
and $\Gamma_2 = \Gamma_1 \cup \{\#\}$
and 
$\delta_2 : Q_2 \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \times {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon \to 
\mathcal{P}(Q_2 \times {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon)$ given by 
\[
\delta_2 ( ~(q,a,b)~) = 
\begin{cases}
\{(q_1, \#)\} &\text{if } q = q_{new}, a = \varepsilon, b = \varepsilon\\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) &\text{if } q\in Q_1 \setminus F_1, a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}, b \in {\Gamma_1}_\varepsilon \\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) &\text{if } q\in F_1, a \in \Sigma, b \in {\Gamma_1}_\varepsilon \\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) &\text{if } q\in F_1, a =\varepsilon, b \in {\Gamma_1} \\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) \cup \{(r_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &\text{if } q\in F_1, a =\varepsilon, b =\varepsilon \\
\{(r_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &\text{if } q = r_{new}, a =\varepsilon, b \in \Gamma_{1} \\
\{(s_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &\text{if } q= r_{new}, a = \varepsilon, b = \#\\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
for each $q \in Q_2$, $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$, 
and $b \in {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon$.

In this question, we'll apply this construction for a specific PDA and 
use this example to extrapolate the effect of this construction.
\begin{enumerate}

\item\gradeCorrect Consider the PDA $M_1$ with input alphabet $\{0,1\}$ 
and stack alphabet $\{0,1, \$\}$ whose state diagram is

\begin{center}

   \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
      \tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=none]
    
    \node[initial,state] (s1)          {$s_1$};
    \node[state] (s2) [right of=s1, xshift=20pt]  {$s_2$};
    \node[state] (s3) [right of=s2, xshift=20pt]  {$s_3$};
    \node[state] (s4) [right of=s3, xshift=20pt]  {$s_4$};
    \node[state, accepting] (s5)  [right of=s4, xshift=20pt]         {$s_5$};

    \path (s1) edge  [bend left=0] node {$\varepsilon,\varepsilon; \$$} (s2)
    (s2) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$1,\varepsilon; 0$} (s2)
    (s2) edge  [bend left=0] node {$\varepsilon,\varepsilon; \varepsilon$} (s3)
    (s3) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$0,0; \varepsilon$} (s3)
    (s3) edge  [bend left=0] node {$0,\$; 0$} (s4)
    (s4) edge  [bend left=0] node {$0,\varepsilon; 0$} (s5)
    ;
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Draw the state diagram for the PDA $M_2$ that results from applying 
the construction to $M_1$. Also, give an example string of length $4$ 
that is accepted by both $M_1$ and $M_2$ and justify your choice by describing 
an accepting computation for each of the PDAs on your input string.

\item\gradeComplete Compare $L(M_1)$ and $L(M_2)$. Are these sets 
equal? Does your answer depend on the specific choice of $M_1$? Why or why not?

\item\gradeComplete Consider the PDA $N$ with input alphabet $\{0,1\}$ and
stack alphabet $\{0,1\}$ whose state diagram is 

\begin{center}
   \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
      \tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=none]
    
    \node[initial,state, accepting] (q1)          {$q_1$};
    \node[state, accepting]         (q2) [right of=q1, xshift=20pt] {$q_2$};
    
    \path (q1) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$0,\varepsilon; 0$} (q1)
        (q1) edge [bend left=0] node {$1,0;\varepsilon$} (q2)
        (q2) edge [loop above, near start] node {$1,0;\varepsilon$} (q2)
    ;
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

   Remember that the definition of set-wise concatenation is:
    for languages $L_1, L_2$ over the alphabet $\Sigma$, we have the 
    associated set of strings
    \[
       L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and } v \in L_2 \}
    \]
    In class, we discussed how extrapolating the construction that we used to prove that the class of regular languages
    is closed under set-wise concatenation by drawing 
    spontaneous transitions from the accepting states in the first 
    machine to the start state of the second machine doesn't work.
    Use the example of $M_1$ and $N$ to prove this by showing that
    \[
    L(M_1) \circ L(N)
    \]
    is {\bf not} the language recognized by the machine 
    results from taking the two machines
    $M_1$ and $N$, setting the start state of $M_1$ to be the start state of 
    the new machine, setting the set of accepting states of $N$ to be
    the set of accepting states of the new machine, and drawing spontaneous 
    arrows from the accepting states
    of $M_1$ to the start state of $N$.
    Then, describe the language recognized by the machine 
    that results from taking the two machines
    $M_2$ and $N$, setting the start state of $M_2$ to be the start state of 
    the new machine, setting the set of accepting states of $N$ to be
    the set of accepting states of the new machine, and drawing spontaneous 
    arrows from the accepting states
    of $M_2$ to the start state of $N$. Use this description 
    to explain why we used the construction of $M_2$ from $M_1$
    and how this construction could be used in a proof of the 
    closure of the class of context-free languages under set-wise concatenation.

    A complete response will give an example string that witnesses that $L(M_1) \circ L(N)$ is not equal to the language recognized by the PDA resulting from the wrong construction (described above) {\bf and} the state diagram 
    of the PDA that results from applying that construction to $M_2$ and $N$ (instead of $M_1$), with a brief justification about why that approach works.

        \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example string $w_1$ of length $4$ over 
        $\Sigma$ that is {\bf accepted} by this Turing machine, or explain why there is no such

        {\it Hint:} In class we've drawn pictures to represent the configuration of the machine at each step 
        in a computation.  You may do so or you may choose to describe these configurations in words.
        
        \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example string $w_2$ of length $3$ over $\Sigma$ 
        that is {\bf rejected} by this Turing machine
        or explain why there is no such 
        example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear

        of the Turing machine on this string or (2) a sufficiently

        \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example string $w_3$ of length $3$ over $\Sigma$ 
        on which  the computation of this Turing machine is {\bf never halts}
        or explain why there is no such 
        example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear

\end{enumerate}



\item\textbf{Implementation-level descriptions of deciders and recognizers} (12 points): Consider the language $$\{a^i b^j \mid i \geq 0, j > 1\}$$
over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]\gradeCorrect Give an example of a Turing machine that {\bf decides} this language.
A complete solution will include  {\bf both} a state diagram and an implementation-level description 
of this Turing machine, along with a brief explanation of why it recognizes this language, and why it is a decider.

\item[(b)]\gradeCorrect Give an example of a Turing machine that {\bf recognizes but does not decide} this language.
A complete solution will include  {\bf both} a state diagram and an implementation-level description 
of this Turing machine, along with a brief explanation of why it recognizes this language, and why it is not a decider.

\end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{Classifying languages} (8 points):
Our first example of a more complicated Turing machine was of a Turing machine 
that recognized the language $\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}$ 
(Figure 3.10 in the textbook), which we 
know is not context-free. Let's call that Turing machine $M_0$. The language
\[
    L = \{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}
\]
is also not context-free. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrect Choose an example string of length $2$ in $L$ that is in {\bf not} in $\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}$ and describe the computation of the Turing machine $M_0$ on your example string. 
    Include the contents of the  tape, the state of the machine, and the location of the read/write head at each step in the computation.
    \item\gradeComplete Explain why the Turing machine from the textbook 
    and class that recognized $\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}$ does 
    not recognize $\{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$. Use your example to explain why $M_0$ doesn't recognize $L$.
    \item\gradeComplete Explain how you would change $M_0$ to get a 
    new Turing machine that does recognize $L$. Describe this new Turing machine using both an implementation-level definition and a state diagram of the Turing machine. You may use all 
    our usual conventions for state diagrams of Turing machines 
    (we do not include the node for the reject state $qrej$ and any missing transitions 
    in the state diagram have value $(qrej,\square,R)$; 
    $b \to R$ label means $b \to b, R$ ).

{\bf Assigned questions}
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]

\item\textbf{Equally expressive models} (10 points):
The {\bf  Church-Turing Thesis} (Sipser p.~183) says that the informal notion of algorithm is formalized completely  and correctly by the 
formal definition of a  Turing machine. In other words: all reasonably expressive models of 
computation are equally expressive with the standard Turing machine.
In this question, we will give support for this thesis by showing that 
some adaptations of the standard (Chapter 3) Turing machine model still 
gives us a new model that is equally expressive.

\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeCompleteFirst Let's define a new machine model, and call it the {\bf May-stay}  machine.
The May-stay machine model is the same as the usual Turing machine model,  except that
on each transition, the tape head may move L, move R, or Stay. 

Formally: a May-stay machine is given by the $7$-tuple
$(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$ where 
$Q$ is a finite set with $q_0 \in Q$ and $q_{accept} \in Q$
and $q_{reject} \in Q$ and $q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}$, 
$\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ are alphabets and $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$ and $\square \in \Gamma$ and $\square \notin \Sigma$, and the transition function 
has signature
\[
  \delta: Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R, S\}
\]
The notions of computation and acceptance are analogous to that from Turing machines.

Prove that Turing machines and May-stay machines are equally expressive.
A complete proof will use the formal definitions of the machines.

{\it Hint: Include two directions of implications. First, let $M$ be an 
arbitrary Turing machine and prove that there's a May-stay machine 
that recognizes the language recognized by $M$. Next, let $M_S$ 
be an arbitrary May-stay 
machine and prove that there's a Turing machine that recognizes the language
recognized by $M_S$.}

\item\gradeCorrectFirst Let's define a new machine model, and call it the {\bf Double-move}  machine.
The Double-move machine model is the same as the usual Turing machine model,  except that on each transition, the tape head may move L, move R one cell, or 
move R two cells. Formally: a Double-move machine is given by the $7$-tuple 
$(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$ where 
$Q$ is a finite set with $q_0 \in Q$ and $q_{accept} \in Q$
and $q_{reject} \in Q$ and $q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}$, 
$\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ are alphabets and $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$ and $\square \in \Gamma$ and $\square \notin \Sigma$, and the transition function 
has signature
\[
  \delta: Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R, T\}
\]
where $L$ means that the read-write head moves to the left one cell (or stays
put if it's at the leftmost cell already), $R$ means that the read-write head 
moves one cell to the right , and $T$ means that the read-write head moves 
two cells to the right. The notion of computation and acceptance are analogous to that from Turing machines.

Prove that Turing machines and Double-move machines are equally expressive.
A complete proof will use the formal definitions of the machines.

{\it Hint: Include two directions of implications. First, let $M$ be an 
arbitrary Turing machine and prove that there's a Double-move machine 
that recognizes the language recognized by $M$. Next, let $M_D$ 
be an arbitrary Double-move
machine and prove that there's a Turing machine that recognizes the language
recognized by $M_D$.}

\item \gradeComplete In your proofs of equal expressivity in the previous 
parts of this question, you proved that a language is recognizable by some
Turing machine if and only if it is recognizable by some May-stay machine
or by some Double-move machine. Do your proofs also prove that a language is 
decidable by some
Turing machine if and only if it is decidable by some May-stay machine
or by some Double-move machine? Justify your answer.
\end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{Modifying machines} (12 points)

\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeCorrect
Suppose a friend suggests that the following construction can be used
to prove that the class of decidable languages is closed under intersection.

Construction: given deciders $M_1$ and $M_2$ build the following machine $M$
\begin{align*}
    M &= ``\text{On input }w:\\
     &\text{1. Run $M_1$ on input $w$.}\\
     &\text{2. If $M_1$ accepts $w$, accept. } \\
     &\text{3. Run $M_2$ on input $w$.} \\
     &\text{4. If $M_2$ accepts $w$, accept.}\\
     &\text{5. If $M_2$ rejects $w$, reject."}\\
 \end{align*}

 Build a counterexample that could be used to convince your friend that this 
 construction doesn't work. A complete counterexample will include (1) a high-level description of $M_1$, (2) a high-level description of $M_2$, (3) a justification for why they provide a counterexample (that references
 the definitions of $M$ , decidable languages, and intersection).

 {\it Ungraded bonus:} Is it possible to change one line of the construction to make it work?

 \item\gradeCorrect
 Suppose a friend suggests that the following construction can be used
 to prove that the class of recognizable languages is closed under intersection.
 
 Construction: given Turing machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ build the following machine $M'$
\begin{align*}
    M' &= ``\text{On input }w:\\
     &\text{1. Run $M_1$ on input $w$.}\\
     &\text{2. If $M_1$ rejects $w$, reject.} \\
     &\text{3. Run $M_2$ on input $w$.} \\
     &\text{4. If $M_2$ rejects $w$, reject."}\\
 \end{align*}

 Build a counterexample that could be used to convince your friend that this 
 construction doesn't work. A complete counterexample will include (1) a high-level description of $M_1$, (2) a high-level description of $M_2$, (3) a justification for why they provide a counterexample (that references the definition of $M'$, recognizable languages, and intersection).


 {\it Ungraded bonus:} Is it possible to change one line of the construction to make it work?
\end{enumerate}

\item\textbf{Closure} (12 points):

For each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]\gradeCorrect Prove whether this Turing machine construction below 
{\bf can} or {\bf cannot} be used to prove that the
class of recognizable languages over $\Sigma$ is closed under the 
Kleene star operation or the $SUBSTRING$ operation or the $EXTEND$ operation.

Suppose $M$ is a Turing machine over the alphabet $\Sigma$. 
Let $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ be a list of all strings in 
$\Sigma^*$ in string (shortlex) order.
We define a new Turing machine
by giving its high-level description as follows: 
\begin{align*}
   M_{a} &= ``\text{On input }w:\\
    &\text{1. For $n = 1, 2, \ldots$}\\
    &\text{2.~~~For $j = 1, 2, \ldots n$} \\
    &\text{3.~~~~~~For $k = 1, 2, \ldots, n$} \\
    &\text{4.~~~~~~~~~Run the computation of $M$ on $s_jws_k$ for at most $n$ steps}\\
    &\text{5.~~~~~~~~~If that computation halts and accepts within $n$ steps, accept.}\\
    &\text{6.~~~~~~~~~Otherwise, continue with the next iteration of this inner loop"}\\
\end{align*}

A complete and correct answer will either identify which operation works and give the proof of correctness why, for any Turing machine $M$, $L(M_{a})$ is equal to the result of applying this operation to $L(M$); {\bf or} give a counterexample (a recognizable set $A$ and a Turing machine $M$ recognizing $A$
and a description of why $L(M_a)$ where $M_a$ is the result of the construction 
applied to $M$ doesn't equal $A^*$ and doesn't equal $SUBSTRING(A)$ and doesn't equal $EXTEND(A)$.

\item[(b)]\gradeCorrect Prove whether this Turing machine construction below 
{\bf can} or {\bf cannot} be used to prove that the
class of recognizable languages over $\Sigma$ is closed under the 
Kleene star operation or the $SUBSTRING$ operation or the $EXTEND$ operation.

Suppose $M$ is a Turing machine over the alphabet $\Sigma$. 
Let $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ be a list of all strings in 
$\Sigma^*$ in string (shortlex) order.
We define a new Turing machine
by giving its high-level description as follows: 
\begin{align*}
    M_{b} &= ``\text{On input }w:\\
     &\text{1. For $n = 1, 2, \ldots$}\\
     &\text{2.~~~For $j = 0, \ldots, |w|$} \\
     &\text{3.~~~~~~Let $u$ be the string consisting of the first $j$ characters of $w$} \\
     &\text{4.~~~~~~Run the computation of $M$ on $u$ for at most $n$ steps}\\
     &\text{5.~~~~~~If that computation halts and accepts within $n$ steps, accept.}\\
     &\text{6.~~~~~~Otherwise, continue with the next iteration of this inner loop"}\\
 \end{align*}

A complete and correct answer will either identify which operation works and give the proof of correctness why, for any Turing machine $M$, $L(M_{b})$ is equal to the result of applying this operation to $L(M$); {\bf or} give a counterexample (a recognizable set $B$ and a Turing machine $M$ recognizing $B$
and a description of why $L(M_b)$ where $M_b$ is the result of the construction 
applied to $M$ doesn't equal equal $B^*$ and doesn't equal $SUBSTRING(B)$ and doesn't equal $EXTEND(B)$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] \gradeComplete Pick three of the computational problems above and give 
    examples (preferably different from the ones we talked about in class) of strings that are
    in each of the corresponding languages. Remember to use the 
    notation $\langle \cdots \rangle$ to denote the string encoding of relevant objects.
    {\it Extension, not for credit:} Explain why it's hard to write a specific string of 
    $0$s and $1$s and make a claim about membership in one of these sets.
    \item[(b)] \gradeComplete Computational problems can also be defined for Turing machines.
    Consider the two high-level descriptions of Turing machines below.
    Reverse-engineer them to define the computational problem that is being
    recognized, where $L(M_{DFA})$ is the language corresponding to this computational
    problem about DFA and $L(M_{TM})$ is the language corresponding to this computational
    problem about Turing machines. {\it Hint}: the computational problem is not acceptance,
    language emptiness, or language equality (but is related to one of them).

    Let $s_1, s_2, \ldots$ be a list of all strings in 
    $\{0,1\}^*$ in string (shortlex) order. Consider the following Turing machines
    \begin{align*}
        M_{DFA} &= ``\text{On input $\langle D \rangle$ where $D$ is a DFA}:\\
         &\text{1. for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$} \\
         &\text{2.~~~ Run $D$ on $s_i$} \\
         &\text{3.~~~~If it accepts, accept.}\\
         &\text{4.~~~~If it rejects, go to the next iteration of the loop"}\\
     \end{align*}
     and
     \begin{align*}
        M_{TM} &= ``\text{On input $\langle T \rangle$ where $T$ is a Turing machine}:\\
         &\text{1. for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$} \\
         &\text{2.~~~ Run $T$ for $i$ steps on each input $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_i$ in turn} \\
         &\text{3.~~~~If $T$ has accepted any of these, accept.}\\
         &\text{4.~~~~Otherwise, go to the next iteration of the loop"}\\
     \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}


\item\textbf{Computational problems} (8 points):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Prove that the language $$\{\langle D \rangle \mid D \text{ is an NFA over $\{0,1\}$ and $D$ accepts at least $3$ strings 
    of length less than $5$ }\}$$

    \item\gradeCorrect Prove that the language $$\{\langle R \rangle \mid R \text{ is a regular expression over $\{0,1\}$ and } L(R) \text{ has

{\bf Assigned questions}
\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]

\item \textbf{What's wrong with these reductions? (if anything)} (16 points):
Suppose your friends are practicing
coming up with mapping reductions $A \leq_m B$ and their witnessing
functions $f: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$. For each of the following 
attempts, determine if it  has error(s) or is correct.
Do so by labelling each attempt with all and 
only the labels below that apply, and justifying
this labelling.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Error Type 1:} The given function 
can't witness the claimed mapping reduction because there
exists an $x \in A$ such that $f(x) \not\in B$.
\item \textit{Error Type 2:} The given function 
can't witness the claimed mapping reduction because there 
exists an $x \not\in A$ such that $f(x) \in B$.
\item \textit{Error Type 3:} The given function 
can't witness the claimed mapping reduction because the specified
function is not computable.
\item \textit{Correct:} The 
claimed mapping reduction is true and 
is witnessed by the given function.
\end{itemize}

Clearly present your answer by
providing a brief (3-4 sentences or so) justification for 
whether {\bf each} of these labels applies to each example.

\item \textbf{Examples of languages} (6 points):

For each part of the question, use precise mathematical notation or English to define your examples
and then briefly justify why they work.


For each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrect Two undecidable languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ over the same alphabet
        whose union $L_1 \cup L_2$ is co-recognizable, or write {\bf NONE}
        if there is no such example (and explain why).
    
    \item\gradeCorrect An unrecognizable
        language $L_3$ for which $EXTEND(L_3)$ is regular
        or write {\bf NONE} if there is no such example (and explain why).
    
    
    \item\gradeComplete A co-recognizable language $L_4$ that is NP-complete,
         or write {\bf NONE} if there is no such example (and explain why).
        Recall the definition: A language $L$ over an  alphabet $\Sigma$ is called {\bf co-recognizable} if its complement,  defined
        as $\Sigma^* \setminus L  = \{ x  \in  \Sigma^* \mid x \notin  L \}$, is Turing-recognizable.

        {\it This part of the question uses definitions from Week 10 of the course.}
