Recap so far: In DFA, the only memory available is in the states. Automata can only
``remember'' finitely far in the past and finitely much information, because
they can have only finitely many states. If a computation path of a DFA visits 
the same state more than once, the machine can't tell the difference between 
the first time and future times it visits this state. Thus, if 
a DFA accepts one long string, then it must accept (infinitely) many 
similar strings.

{\bf Definition}  A positive integer $p$ is a {\bf pumping length} of a language $L$ over $\Sigma$ means
that, for each string $s  \in  \Sigma^*$, if  $|s| \geq p$ and $s \in L$, then there are strings $x,y,z$
such that 
\[
s = xyz
\]
and  
\[
|y| > 0,  \qquad \qquad 
\text{ for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^i z \in L$}, \qquad \text{and}
\qquad  \qquad
|xy| \leq p.
\]

{\bf Negation}: A positive integer  $p$  is {\bf not a pumping length} of a language  $L$ over  $\Sigma$  iff
\[
\exists s \left(~  |s| \geq  p \wedge s \in L \wedge \forall x \forall y \forall z  \left( ~\left( s = xyz \wedge 
|y| > 0 \wedge |xy| \leq p~ \right) \to \exists i  (  i \geq 0  \wedge xy^iz  \notin L ) \right) ~\right) 
\]
{\it Informally: }


Restating {\bf Pumping Lemma}: If $L$ is a regular language, then it  has
a pumping length.


{\bf Contrapositive}: If $L$ has no pumping length, then  it is nonregular.

{\bf Proof strategy}: To prove that a language $L$ is {\bf not} regular, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider an arbitrary positive integer $p$
    \item Prove that $p$ is not a pumping length for $L$
    \item Conclude that $L$ does not have {\it any} pumping length, and therefore it is not regular.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Example}: $\Sigma  =  \{0,1\}$, $L = \{ 0^n 1^n \mid n  \geq 0\}$.

Fix $p$ an arbitrary positive integer. List strings that are in $L$ and have length  greater than or equal  to $p$:

\vspace{20pt}

Pick $s = $


Suppose $s = xyz$ with  $|xy|  \leq  p$ and $|y| > 0$.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
 \\
\hspace{4in} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Then when $i = \hspace{1in}$, $xy^i z  = \hspace{1in}$

{\bf Example}: $\Sigma  =  \{0,1\}$, $L = \{w w^{\mathcal{R}} \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$.
Remember that the reverse of a string $w$ is denoted $w^\mathcal{R}$  
and means to write $w$  in  the opposite order, if $w = w_1 \cdots  w_n$ then $w^\mathcal{R} = w_n \cdots  w_1$. Note: $\varepsilon^\mathcal{R} = \varepsilon$.
