What is $L(M_1)$?

Is $M_1$ a decider?

{\it Alternate description}:
Sometimes omit step 0 from listing and do implicit type check.

Synonyms: ``Simulate'', ``run'', ``call''.

To build a Turing machine that decides $EQ_{DFA}$, notice that 
\[
L_1 = L_2 \qquad\textrm{iff}\qquad (~(L_1 \cap \overline{L_2}) \cup (L_2 \cap \overline L_1)~) = \emptyset  
\]
{\it There are no elements that are in one set and not the other}

  {\bf Summary}:  We can use the decision procedures (Turing machines) of decidable problems
  as subroutines in other algorithms. For example, we have subroutines for deciding each of 
  $A_{DFA}$, $E_{DFA}$, $EQ_{DFA}$.  We can also use algorithms for known constructions
  as subroutines in other algorithms. For example, we have subroutines for: counting the number 
  of states in a state diagram, counting the number of characters in an alphabet, converting DFA
  to a DFA recognizing the complement of the original language or a DFA recognizing the 
  Kleene star of the original language, constructing a DFA or NFA from two DFA or NFA so that 
  we have a machine recognizing the language of the union (or intersection, concatenation)
  of the languages of the original machines; converting regular expressions to equivalent DFA; 
  converting DFA to equivalent regular expressions, etc.
