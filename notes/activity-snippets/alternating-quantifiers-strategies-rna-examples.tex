$$\forall s \in S ~\exists b\in B ~(~basecount(~(s,b)~) = 3~)$$

In English: For each RNA strand there is a base that occurs 3 times in this strand.\\

Write the negation and use De Morgan's law to find a 
logically equivalent version where the negation is applied only to the 
$BC$ predicate (not next to a quantifier).

Is the original statement {\bf True} or {\bf False}?

$$\exists s \in S ~\forall b \in B ~\exists n \in \mathbb{N} ~(~basecount(~(s,b)~) = n~)$$

In English: There is an RNA strand so that for each base there is some nonnegative
integer that counts the number of occurrences of that base in this strand.\\

Write the negation and use De Morgan's law to find a 
logically equivalent version where the negation is applied only to the
