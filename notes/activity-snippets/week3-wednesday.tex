{\bf Definition and Theorem}: For an alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ over $\Sigma$ is called {\bf regular}
exactly when $L$ is recognized by some DFA, which happens exactly when $L$ is recognized by some NFA, 
and happens exactly when $L$ is described by some regular expression

{\bf We saw that}: The class of regular languages is closed under complementation, union, 
intersection, set-wise concatenation, and Kleene star.

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: There is some alphabet $\Sigma$ for which there is 
some language recognized by an NFA but not by any DFA.

\vfill

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: There is some alphabet $\Sigma$ for which there is 
some finite language not described by any regular expression over $\Sigma$.

\vfill

{\bf Prove or Disprove}: If a language is recognized by an NFA 
then the complement of this language is not recognized by any DFA.

Strategy: Find an {\bf invariant} property that is true of all regular languages. When analyzing 
a given language, if the invariant is not true about it, then the language is not regular.
\newpage

{\bf Pumping Lemma} (Sipser Theorem 1.70): If $A$ is a regular language, then there
is a number $p$ (a {\it pumping length}) where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, 
then $s$ may be divided into three pieces, $s = xyz$ such that
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{itemize}
\item $|y| > 0$
\item for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^i z \in A$
\item $|xy| \leq p$.
\end{itemize}


{\bf Proof illustration}

{\bf True or False}: A pumping length for $A = \{ 0,1 \}^*$ is $p = 5$.
