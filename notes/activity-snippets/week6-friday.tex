Definition: A language $L$ over an  alphabet $\Sigma$ is called {\bf co-recognizable} if its complement,  defined
as $\Sigma^* \setminus L  = \{ x  \in  \Sigma^* \mid x \notin  L \}$, is Turing-recognizable.


\vfill 
{\bf  Theorem} (Sipser Theorem 4.22): A  language is Turing-decidable if and only if both  it and its complement
are Turing-recognizable.

{\bf Proof, first direction:}  Suppose  language  $L$ is  Turing-decidable.   WTS  that both it and its complement 
are Turing-recognizable.

\vfill

{\bf Proof, second direction:}  Suppose  language  $L$ is  Turing-recognizable, and  so is  its complement.   WTS  that $L$
is Turing-decidable.

Notation: The complement  of a set $X$ is denoted with  a superscript $c$, $X^c$, or an overline,  $\overline{X}$.

{\bf Claim}: If two languages  (over a fixed alphabet  $\Sigma$) are Turing-decidable, then  their union  is  as well.
