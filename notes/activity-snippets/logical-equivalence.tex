{\bf Logical equivalence }: Two compound  propositions are {\bf logically  equivalent} means that  they 
have the  same  truth  values for all settings of truth  values to their propositional  variables.

{\bf Tautology}:  A compound proposition that evaluates to true
for all settings of truth  values to its propositional  variables; it is  abbreviated $T$.

{\bf Contradiction}: A compound proposition that  evaluates  to  false 
for  all settings of truth  values to its propositional  variables; it  is abbreviated $F$.

{\bf Contingency}: A compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.
