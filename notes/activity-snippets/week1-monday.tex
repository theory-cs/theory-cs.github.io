We will use vocabulary that should be familiar from your discrete 
math and introduction to proofs classes.  Some of the notation conventions may 
be a bit different: we will use the notation from this class' textbook\footnote{Page references are to 
the 3rd edition (International) of Siper's Introduction to the Theory of Computation,
available at the campus bookstore for under \$20. Copies of the book are also available 
for those who can't access the book
to borrow from the course instructor, while supplies last (minnes@eng.ucsd.edu)}.

Write out in words the meaning of the symbols below: 
\[
    \{ a,b, c\}
\]

\phantom{The set whose elements are $a$, $b$, and $c$}

\[
    | \{a, b, a \} | = 2
\]

\phantom{The number of elements in the set $\{a,b,a\}$ is $2$.}

\[
    | aba | = 3
\]

\phantom{The length of the string $aba$ is $3$.}

\[
    (a, 3, 2, b, b)
\]

\phantom{The $5$-tuple whose first components is $a$, second component 
is $3$, third component is $2$, fourth component is $b$, and fifth component is $b$.}

{\it Circle the correct choice}:

A {\bf string} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is \underline{~~an element of $\Sigma^*$ ~~ OR ~~ a subset of $\Sigma^*$}.
    
A {\bf language} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is \underline{~~an element of $\Sigma^*$ ~~ OR ~~ a subset of $\Sigma^*$}.


{\it Extra examples for practice:}

With $\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}$ and $\Sigma_2 = \{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z\}$  and $\Gamma = \{0,1,x,y,z\}$

An example of a string of length 3 over $\Sigma_1$ is \underline{\phantom{ $000$} \hspace{0.2in}}

An example of  a string of length 1 over $\Sigma_2$ is  \underline{\phantom{ $k$} \hspace{0.2in}}

The number of distinct strings of length 2 over $\Gamma$ is  \underline{\phantom{ $25$} \hspace{0.2in}}

An example of a language over $\Sigma_1$ of size $1$ is  \underline{\phantom{ $ \{ \varepsilon \} $} \hspace{0.2in}}

An example of an infinite language over $\Sigma_1$ is  \underline{\phantom{ $\Sigma^*$} \hspace{0.2in}}
    
An example of  a finite language over $\Gamma$ is  \underline{\phantom{ $\{ 0, x \}$} \hspace{0.2in}}
    
{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon \in \Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon$ is  a string over $\Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon$ is a language over $\Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon$ is a prefix of some string over  $\Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: There is a string over $\Sigma_1$ that is a proper prefix of $\varepsilon$
