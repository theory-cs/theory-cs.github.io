    {\bf Describing  Turing machines} (Sipser p. 185)
    
    The Church-Turing thesis posits that each algorithm can be implemented by some Turing machine

    High-level descriptions of  Turing machine algorithms are written as indented text within quotation marks.   

    Stages of the algorithm are typically numbered consecutively.

    The first line specifies the input to the machine, which must be a string.
    This string may be the encoding of some object or  list of  objects.  
    
    {\bf Notation:} $\langle O \rangle$ is the string that encodes the object $O$.
    $\langle O_1, \ldots, O_n \rangle$ is the string that encodes the list of objects $O_1, \ldots, O_n$.
    
    {\bf Assumption}: There are Turing  machines that can be called as subroutines
    to decode the string representations of common objects and  interact with these objects as intended
    (data structures).
    
    \newpage    
    For example, since there are algorithms to answer each of the following questions,
    by Church-Turing thesis, there is a Turing machine that accepts exactly those strings for which the 
    answer to the question is ``yes''
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Does a string over $\{0,1\}$ have even length?

        \vfill

        \item Does a string over $\{0,1\}$ encode a string of ASCII characters?\footnote{An introduction to ASCII 
        is available on the w3 tutorial \href{https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp}{here}.}

        \vfill

        \item Does a DFA have a specific number of states?

        \vfill

        \item Do two NFAs have any state names in common?

        \vfill

        \item Do two CFGs have the same start variable?

        \vfill

      \end{itemize}

A {\bf computational problem} is decidable iff language encoding its positive problem instances
is decidable.

The computational problem ``Does a specific DFA accept a given string?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of DFAs $M$ and strings $w$ such that $w \in L(M)$}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid M \textrm{ is a DFA}, w \textrm{ is a string}, w \in L(M) \}
\end{align*}

The computational problem ``Is the language generated by a CFG empty?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of CFGs $G$  such that $L(G) = \emptyset$}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \textrm{ is a CFG},  L(G) = \emptyset \}
\end{align*}



The computational problem ``Is the given Turing machine a decider?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of TMs $M$  such that $M$ halts on every input}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \textrm{ is a TM and for each string } w, \textrm{$M$ halts on $w$} \}
\end{align*}


{\it Note: writing down the language encoding a computational problem is only the first step in 
determining if it's recognizable, decidable, or \ldots }


{\bf Some classes of computational problems help us understand the differences between the machine models we've been studying:}
