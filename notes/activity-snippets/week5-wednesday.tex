{\it Summary}

Over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ is {\bf regular}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{center}
    iff it is described by some regular expression \\
    iff it is recognized by some DFA\\
    iff it is recognized by some NFA
\end{center}

Over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ is {\bf context-free}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{center}
    iff it is generated by some CFG\\
    iff it is recognized by some PDA
\end{center}

\vfill

{\bf Fact}: Every regular language is a context-free language.

\vfill

{\bf Fact}: There are context-free languages that are not nonregular.

\vfill

{\bf Fact}: There are countably many regular languages.

\vfill

{\bf Fact}: There are countably infinitely many context-free languages.

\vfill

{\it Consequence}: Most languages are {\bf not} context-free!

{\bf Examples  of non-context-free languages}

\begin{align*}
    &\{ a^n b^n c^n \mid 0 \leq n , n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\{ a^i b^j c^k \mid 0 \leq i \leq j \leq k , i \in \mathbb{Z}, j \in \mathbb{Z}, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\{ ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^* \}
\end{align*}
(Sipser Ex 2.36, Ex 2.37, 2.38)

There is a Pumping Lemma for CFL that can be used to prove a specific language is non-context-free: 
If $A$ is a context-free language, there
is a number $p$ where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided 
into five pieces $s = uvxyz$ where (1) for each $i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$, (2) $|uv|>0$, (3) $|vxy| \leq p$.
{\it We will not go into the details of the proof or application of Pumping Lemma for CFLs this quarter.}


Recall: A set $X$ is said to be {\bf closed} under an operation $OP$ if, for any elements in $X$, applying 
$OP$ to them gives an element in $X$.
