A {\bf Turing-recognizable} language is a set of strings that 
is the language recognized by some Turing machine. We also 
say that such languages are recognizable.

A {\bf Turing-decidable} language is a set of strings that 
is the language recognized by some decider. We also 
say that such languages are decidable.


An {\bf unrecognizable} language is a language that is not Turing-recognizable.

An {\bf undecidable} language is a language that is not Turing-decidable.

{\bf  True} or {\bf False}: Any  decidable language  is  also  recognizable.

{\bf  True} or {\bf False}: Any  recognizable language  is  also  decidable.

{\bf  True} or {\bf False}: Any  undecidable language  is  also  unrecognizable.

{\bf  True} or {\bf False}: Any  unrecognizable language  is  also  undecidable.

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: The class of Turing-decidable languages is closed under complementation.

{\bf  Church-Turing Thesis} (Sipser p. 183): The informal notion of algorithm is formalized completely  and correctly by the 
formal definition of a  Turing machine. In other words: all reasonably expressive models of 
computation are equally expressive with the standard Turing machine.
