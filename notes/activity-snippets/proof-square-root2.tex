{\bf Goal}:  The square root of $2$ is not a rational number.  In other words: $\neg \exists x \in \mathbb{Q} ( x^2 -  2 = 0)$

{\bf Attempted proof}: The definition of the set of rational numbers is the collection of fractions $p/q$ where $p$ is an integer and $q$ is a nonzero integer. Looking for a {\bf witness} $p$ and $q$, we can write the square root of $2$ as the fraction 
$\sqrt{2 }/1$, where $1$ is a nonzero integer. Since the numerator is not in the domain, this witness is not allowed, and we have shown that the square root of $2$ is not a fraction of integers (with nonzero denominator). Thus, the square root of $2$ is not rational.


{\it The problem in the above attempted proof is that} \underline{\phantom{it only considers one candidate witness
and does not prove that no witnesses exist.}}

{\bf Lemma 1:} For every two integers $p$  and  $q$, not both zero, $gcd\left( \frac{p}{gcd(p,q) },  \frac{q}{gcd(p,q)} \right) =  1$.


{\bf Lemma 2:} For every two integers $a$ and  $b$, not both zero, with  $gcd(a,b) = 1$, it is not the case that both $a$
is  even and $b$ is even.


{\bf Lemma 3:} For every integer  $x$, $x$ is  even if and only if $x^2$  is even.
