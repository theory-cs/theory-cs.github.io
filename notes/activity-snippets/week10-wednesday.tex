Definition (Sipser 7.29) Language  $A$ is {\bf polynomial-time mapping reducible} to language $B$, written $A \leq_P B$,
means there is a polynomial-time computable function $f: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$  such that for every $x \in \Sigma^*$
\[
x \in A \qquad \text{iff} \qquad f(x) \in B.
\]
The  function $f$ is  called the  polynomial time reduction of $A$ to $B$.

{\bf  Theorem}  (Sipser 7.31):  If $A \leq_P B$ and $B  \in P$ then $A \in P$.

Proof:

Definition (Sipser 7.34; based in Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin's work in the 1970s): 
A language $B$ is {\bf  NP-complete} means (1) $B$ is in NP {\bf and}  (2) every language
$A$ in $NP$ is polynomial time reducible to $B$.

{\bf  Theorem}  (Sipser 7.35):  If $B$ is NP-complete and $B \in P$ then $P = NP$.

{\bf 3SAT}: A literal is a Boolean variable (e.g.  $x$) or a negated Boolean variable (e.g.  $\bar{x}$).  
A Boolean formula is a {\bf  3cnf-formula} if it is a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (a conjunction  
of  disjunctive clauses of literals) and each clause  has  three literals.
\[
3SAT  = \{  \langle  \phi \rangle \mid \text{$\phi$ is  a  satisfiable 3cnf-formula} \}
\]


Example string  in $3SAT$
\[
   \langle (x \vee \bar{y} \vee {\bar z}) \wedge (\bar{x}  \vee y  \vee  z) \wedge (x \vee y  \vee z) \rangle
\]



Example  string not  in $3SAT$
\[
   \langle (x \vee y \vee z) \wedge 
    (x \vee y \vee{\bar z}) \wedge
    (x \vee \bar{y} \vee z) \wedge
    (x \vee \bar{y} \vee \bar{z}) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee y \vee z) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee y \vee{\bar z}) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee \bar{y} \vee z) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee \bar{y} \vee \bar{z}) \rangle
\]



{\bf Cook-Levin Theorem}: $3SAT$ is $NP$-complete.


{\it Are there other $NP$-complete problems?} To prove that $X$ is $NP$-complete
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it From scratch}: prove $X$ is in $NP$ and that all $NP$ problems are polynomial-time
reducible to $X$.
\item {\it Using reduction}: prove $X$ is in $NP$ and that a known-to-be $NP$-complete problem 
is polynomial-time reducible to $X$.

{\bf CLIQUE}: A {\bf $k$-clique} in an undirected graph is a maximally connected subgraph with $k$  nodes.
\[
CLIQUE  = \{  \langle G, k \rangle \mid \text{$G$ is an  undirected graph with  a $k$-clique} \}
\]

Theorem (Sipser 7.32):
\[
3SAT  \leq_P CLIQUE
\]

Given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form with $k$ clauses and three literals per clause, we will 
map it to a graph so that the graph has a clique if the original formula is satisfiable and the 
graph does not have a clique if the original formula is not satisfiable.

The graph has $3k$ vertices (one for each literal in each clause) and an edge between all vertices except
\begin{itemize}
    \item vertices for two literals in the same clause
    \item vertices for literals that are negations of one another
\end{itemize}

Example: $(x \vee \bar{y} \vee {\bar z}) \wedge (\bar{x}  \vee y  \vee  z) \wedge (x \vee y  \vee z)$
