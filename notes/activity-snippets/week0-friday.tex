The CSE 105 vocabulary and notation build on discrete
math and introduction to proofs classes.  Some of the conventions may 
be a bit different from what you saw before so we'll draw your attention to them.

For consistency, we will use the notation from this class' textbook\footnote{Page references are to 
the 3rd edition of Sipser's Introduction to the Theory of Computation,
available through various sources for approximately \$30. You may be able to 
opt in to purchase a digital copy through Canvas. Copies of the book are also available 
for those who can't access the book
to borrow from the course instructor, while supplies last (minnes@ucsd.edu)}.

These definitions are on pages 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 53.

{\it Circle the correct choice}:

A {\bf string} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is \underline{~~an element of $\Sigma^*$ ~~ OR ~~ a subset of $\Sigma^*$}.
    
A {\bf language} over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is \underline{~~an element of $\Sigma^*$ ~~ OR ~~ a subset of $\Sigma^*$}.


With $\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}$ and 
$\Sigma_2 = \{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z\}$
and $\Gamma = \{0,1,x,y,z\}$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon \in \Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon$ is  a string over $\Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon$ is a language over $\Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: $\varepsilon$ is a prefix of some string over  $\Sigma_1$

{\bf True} or {\bf False}: There is a string over $\Sigma_1$ that is a proper prefix of $\varepsilon$
