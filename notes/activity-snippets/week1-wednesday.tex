Our motivation in studying sets of strings is that they encode problems.

We need to describe the collection of all strings that match the pattern or property of a problem.

Let's start by thinking about how we can describe a language (a set of strings from a given alphabet).

{\bf Definition 1.52}: A {\bf regular expression} over alphabet $\Sigma$
is a syntactic expression that can describe a language over $\Sigma$. The collection of all regular
expressions is defined recursively:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}    
    $a$ is a regular expression, for $a \in \Sigma$

    $\varepsilon$ is a regular expression

    $\emptyset$ is a regular expression
\end{quote}

\item[] {\it Recursive steps of recursive definition}
\begin{quote}
    $(R_1 \cup R_2)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions 

    $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions

    $(R_1^*)$ is a regular expression when $R_1$ is a regular expression 
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
 

The {\it semantics} (or meaning) of the syntactic regular expression is the {\bf language
described by the regular expression}. The function that assigns a language to a regular expression
over $\Sigma$ is defined recursively, using familiar set operations:


\begin{itemize}
    \item[] {\it Basis steps of recursive definition}
    \begin{quote}    
        The language described by $a$, for $a \in \Sigma$, is $\{a\}$ and we write 
        $L(a) = \{a\}$
    
        The language described by $\varepsilon$ is $\{\varepsilon\}$ and we write 
        $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon\}$
    
        The language described by $\emptyset$ is $\{\}$ and we write
        $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$.
    \end{quote}
    
    \item[] {\it Recursive steps of recursive definition}
    \begin{quote}
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \cup R_2)$ is the union of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \cup R_2)~) = L(R_1) \cup L(R_2) = \{ w \mid w \in L(R_1) \lor w \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$, $R_2$ are regular expressions, the language described by the regular
        expression $(R_1 \circ R_2)$ is the concatenation of the languages described by $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
        and we write 
        $$L(~(R_1 \circ R_2)~) = L(R_1) \circ L(R_2) = \{ uv \mid u \in L(R_1) \land v \in L(R_2)\}$$
    
        When $R_1$ is a regular expression, the language described by the regular 
        expression $(R_1^*)$ is the {\bf Kleene star} of the language described by $R_1$ and we write
        $$L(~(R_1^*)~) = (~L(R_1)~)^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L(R_1)\}$$
    \end{quote}
\end{itemize}
  
For the following examples assume the alphabet is $\Sigma_1 =  \{0,1\}$:
    
The language described by the regular expression $0$ is $L(0) = \{ 0 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $1$ is $L(1)  = \{ 1 \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\varepsilon$ is $L(\varepsilon) = \{ \varepsilon  \}$

The language described by the regular expression $\emptyset$ is $L(\emptyset) = \emptyset$

The language described by the regular expression $((0 \cup 1) \cup 1)$ is $L(~((0 \cup 1) \cup 1)~) = $

\vfill

The language described by the regular expression $1^+$ is $L(~(1)^+~) = $

\vfill

The language described by the regular expression $\Sigma_1^* 1$ is $L(~\Sigma_1^* 1~) = $

\vfill

The language described by the regular expression $(\Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1)^*$ 
is $L(~(\Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1 \Sigma_1)^*~) = $

A regular expression that describes the language $\{00, 01, 10, 11\}$ is

A regular expression that describes the language $\{ 0^n1 \mid n~\text{is even} \}$ is

    \begin{tabular}{|ll|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Assuming $\Sigma$ is the alphabet, we use the following conventions}\\
    \hline
    $\Sigma$   & regular  expression describing language consisting of  all strings  of length  $1$ over $\Sigma$\\
    $*$ then $\circ$ then $\cup$   & precedence order, unless parentheses are used to change it\\
    $R_1R_2$ & shorthand  for  $R_1  \circ R_2$ (concatenation symbol is implicit) \\
    $R^+$ & shorthand for $R^* \circ R$ \\
    $R^k$ & shorthand for $R$ concatenated with itself $k$ times, where $k$ is a natural number\\

\newpage
{\bf Caution: many programming languages that support regular expressions build in functionality
that is more powerful than the ``pure'' definition of regular expressions given here. }

Regular expressions are everywhere (once you start looking for them).

Software tools and languages often have built-in support for regular expressions to describe
{\bf patterns} that we want to match (e.g. Excel/ Sheets, grep, Perl, python, Java, Ruby).

Under the hood, the first phase of {\bf compilers} is to transform the strings we write 
in code to tokens (keywords, operators, identifiers, literals). Compilers use regular expressions
to describe the sets of strings that can be used for each token type.

Next time: we'll start to see how to build machines that decide whether strings match the pattern
described by a regular expression.
