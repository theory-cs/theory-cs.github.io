What data should we encode about each Netflix account holder to help us make effective recommendations?

In machine learning, clustering can be used to group similar data for prediction and recommendation.  For example,
each Netflix user's viewing history can be represented as a $n$-tuple indicating their preferences about
movies in the database, where $n$ is the number of movies in the database.  People with similar tastes in movies can then be clustered to provide recommendations
of movies for one another.  Mathematically, clustering is based on a notion of distance between pairs of $n$-tuples.
