{\bf Definition}  (Rosen p143): A function $f: D  \to C$ is {\bf onto} (or  surjective) means for every $b$ in the codomain, 
there  is an element $a$ in the domain with  $f(a) = b$.


Formally, $f: D  \to  C$ is  onto  means $\underline{\phantom{\forall b \in C  \exists a \in D ( f(a) = b)}}$.


{\bf Definition}:  For sets $A, B$, we say that  {\bf the  cardinality of $A$ is  no  smaller than the cardinality of  $B$}, and 
write $|A| \geq |B|$, to mean there is an onto function  with domain $A$  and codomain $B$.
