    I moved the following to the review quiz.

    {\it Extra practice}: Is there a CFG $G$ with $L(G) = \emptyset$?


  Three different CFGs that each generate the  language $\{abba\}$
  
  \begin{align*}
  & ( \{ S, T, V, W\}, \{a,b\}, \{ S \to aT, T \to bV, V \to bW, W \to a\}, S)\\

{\bf Theorem  2.20}: A language is  generated by some context-free  grammar
if  and only if it is recognized by some push-down automaton.

Definition: a language is called {\bf context-free} if it is the language generated by a context-free grammar.
The class of all context-free language over a given alphabet $\Sigma$ is called {\bf CFL}.

Consequences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quick proof that every regular language is context free 
    \item To prove closure of the class of context-free languages under a given operation, we can choose 
    either of two modes 
    of proof (via CFGs or PDAs) depending on which is easier
    \item To fully specify a PDA we could give its $6$-tuple formal definition or we could give its input 
alphabet, stack alphabet, and state diagram.
An informal description of a PDA is a step-by-step description of how its computations 
would process input strings; the reader should be able to reconstruct the state diagram or formal 
definition precisely from such a descripton. The informal description of a PDA can refer to some 
common modules or subroutines that are computable by PDAs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item PDAs can ``test for emptiness of stack'' without providing details. 
  {\it How?} We can always push a special end-of-stack symbol, $\$$, at the start, before processing
  any input, and then use this symbol as a flag.
  \item PDAs can ``test for end of input'' without providing details.
  {\it How?} We can transform a PDA to one where accepting states are only those reachable 
  when there are no more input symbols.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\newpage
Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free languages over $\Sigma$.  {\bf Goal}:  $L_1 \cup L_2$  is  also context-free.

{\it Approach 1: with  PDAs}

Let $M_1 = ( Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and
$M_2 = ( Q_2, \Sigma, \Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)$ be PDAs with 
$L(M_1) =  L_1$  and  $L(M_2) = L_2$.

Define $M = $

\vfill

{\it Approach  2: with CFGs}

Let $G_1 = (V_1, \Sigma, R_1, S_1)$  and   $G_2 = (V_2, \Sigma, R_2, S_2)$  be CFGs  with
$L(G_1) =  L_1$  and  $L(G_2) = L_2$.

Define $G = $

{\it Summary}

Over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ is {\bf regular}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{center}
    iff it is described by some regular expression \\
    iff it is recognized by some DFA\\
    iff it is recognized by some NFA
\end{center}

Over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ is {\bf context-free}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{center}
    iff it is generated by some CFG\\
    iff it is recognized by some PDA
\end{center}

{\bf Fact}: Every regular language is a context-free language.

{\bf Fact}: There are context-free languages that are not nonregular.

{\bf Fact}: There are countably many regular languages.

{\bf Fact}: There are countably inifnitely many context-free languages.

{\it Consequence}: Most languages are {\bf not} context-free!

{\bf Examples  of non-context-free languages}

\begin{align*}
    &\{ a^n b^n c^n \mid 0 \leq n , n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\{ a^i b^j c^k \mid 0 \leq i \leq j \leq k , i \in \mathbb{Z}, j \in \mathbb{Z}, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\{ ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^* \}
\end{align*}
(Sipser Ex 2.36, Ex 2.37, 2.38)

There is a Pumping Lemma for CFL that can be used to prove a specific language is non-context-free: 
If $A$ is a context-free language, there there
is a number $p$ where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided 
into five pieces $s = uvxyz$ where (1) for each $i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$, (2) $|uv|>0$, (3) $|vxy| \leq p$.
{\it We will not go into the details of the proof or application of Pumping Lemma for CFLs this quarter.}

##Moved to review quiz
A set $X$ is said to be {\bf closed} under an operation $OP$ if, for any elements in $X$, applying 
$OP$ to them gives an element in $X$.

The test covers material in Weeks 1 through 4 and Monday of Week 5.  To study for the exam, 
we recommend reviewing class notes (e.g. annotations linked on the class website, podcast, 
supplementary video from the class website), reviewing homework (and its posted sample solutions), 
and in particular *working examples* (extra examples in lecture notes, textbook examples listed in hw, 
review quizzes -- PDFs now available on the class website, discussion examples) and getting feedback (office hours and Piazza).

\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the computational complexity of a set of strings by determining whether it is regular
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine whether a language is recognizable by a (D or N) FA and/or a PDA
    \end{itemize}
\item Use context-free grammars and relate them to languages and pushdown automata
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify the components of a formal definition of a context-free grammar (CFG)
        \item Use context-free grammars and relate them to languages and pushdown automata.
        \item Derive strings in the language of a given CFG
        \item Determine the language of a given CFG
        \item Design a CFG generating a given language
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{TODO:}
\begin{list}
   {\itemsep2pt}
   \item Review quizzes based on class material each day.
   \item Test this Friday in Discussion section.
   \item Homework assignment 3 due next Thursday.
