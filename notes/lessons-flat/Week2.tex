In Computer Science, we operationalize ``hardest'' as ``requires most resources'', where
resources might be memory, time, parallelism, randomness, power, etc.
To be able to compare ``hardness'' of problems, we use a consistent description of problems

{\bf Input}: String

{\bf Output}: Yes/ No, where Yes means that the input string matches the pattern or property described by the problem.

So far: we saw that regular expressions are convenient ways of describring patterns in strings.
{\bf Finite automata} give a model of computation for processing strings and and classifying them into Yes (accepted)
or No (rejected). We will see that each set of strings is described by a regular expression if and only 
if there is a FA that recognizes it.  Another way of thinking about it: properties described by regular
expressions require exactly the computational power of these finite automata.

\subsection*{Monday: Finite automaton constructions}



{\bf Review}: Formal definition of DFA: $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ 

\begin{center}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{2pt}
\item Finite set of states $Q$
\item Alphabet $\Sigma$
\item Transition function $\delta$
\item Start state $q_0$
\item Accept (final) states $F$
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\end{center}
In the state diagram of $M$, how many outgoing arrows are there from each state?

$M = ( \{ q, r, s\}, \{a,b\}, \delta, q, \{s\} )$ 
where $\delta$ is  (rows labelled by states
and columns labelled by symbols):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc}
$\delta$ & $a$ & $b$ \\
\hline
$q$ & $r$ & $q$ \\
$r$ & $r$ & $s$ \\
$s$ & $s$ & $s$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The state diagram for $M$ is 

\vfill



Give two examples of strings that are accepted by $M$ and two examples of strings that are rejected by $M$:

\vfill

Add ``labels" for states in the state diagram, e.g. ``have not seen any of desired pattern yet'' or
``sink state''.
\newpage

We can use the analysis of the roles of the states in the state diagram to describe the language
recognized by the DFA. 


$L(M) = $

A regular expression describing $L(M)$ is

Let the alphabet be $\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}$.

A state diagram for a DFA that recognizes $\{w \mid w~\text{contains at most two $1$'s} \}$ is

A state diagram for a DFA that recognizes $\{w \mid w~\text{contains more than two $1$'s} \}$ is

\newpage
{\it Extra example:} A state diagram for DFA recognizing
$$\{w \mid w~\text{is a string over $\{0,1\}$ whose length is not a multiple of $3$} \}$$

\vspace{70pt}


Let $n$ be an arbitrary positive integer. What is a formal definition for a DFA recognizing
\[
\{w \mid w~\text{is a string over $\{0,1\}$ whose length is not a multiple of $n$} \}?
\]

\vfill

{\bf Note}: On Wednesday, we'll see a new kind of finite automaton. It will be helpful to distinguish it from the
machines we've been talking about so we'll use {\bf Deterministic Finite Automaton} (DFA) to refer to the machines 
from Section 1.1.

The formal definition of the NFA over $\{0,1\}$ given by this state diagram is:

Change the transition function to get a different NFA which accepts
the empty string (and potentially other strings too).

\subsection*{Friday: Automata constructions}

{\bf Warmup}: Design a DFA (deterministic finite automaton) and an NFA (nondeterministic
finite automaton) that each recognize each of the following languages over $\{a,b\}$
\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ and ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill

\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ or ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill



\textbf{Strategy}: To design DFA or NFA for a given language,  
identify patterns that can be built up as we process strings and create states
for intermediate stages. Or: decompose the language to a simpler one 
that we already know how to recognize with a DFA or NFA.


{\it Recall} (from Wednesday of last week, and in textbook Exercise 1.14): 
if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.


Let's practice defining automata constructions by coming up with other ways to get new automata from old.
\newpage

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Use nondeterminism to choose which of $N_1$, $N_2$ to run.

\vfill
\begin{comment}
    Draw schematic
\end{comment}

{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$
and assume $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$ and that $q_0 \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2$.
Construct $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q = $
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is defined by, for $q \in Q$ and $x \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:
        \[
            \phantom{\delta((q,x))=\begin{cases}  \delta_1 ((q,x)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_1 \\ \delta_2 ((q,x)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_2 \\ \{q1,q2\} &\qquad\text{if } q = q_0, x = \varepsilon \\ \emptyset\text{if } q= q_0, x \neq \varepsilon \end{cases}}
        \]
\end{itemize}


\vfill
{\it Proof of correctness would prove that $L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$ by considering
an arbitrary string accepted by $N$, tracing an accepting computation of $N$ on it, and using 
that trace to prove the string is in at least one of $A_1$, $A_2$; then, taking an arbitrary 
string in $A_1 \cup A_2$ and proving that it is accepted by $N$. Details left for extra practice.}

Could we do the same construction with DFA?

\vspace{50pt}

Happily, though, an analogous claim is true!

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M_1$ such that $L(M_1) = A_1$ and 
DFA $M_2$ such that $L(M_2) = A_2$, then there is another DFA, let's call it $M$, such that 
$L(M) = A_1 \cup A_2$. {\it Theorem 1.25 in Sipser, page 45}
