Recall definition:  $A$ is  {\bf  mapping  reducible to} $B$  means there is a computable function 
$f : \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$ such that {\it for all} strings  $x$ in $\Sigma^*$, 
\[
x  \in  A \qquad \qquad \text{if and  only  if} \qquad \qquad f(x) \in B.
\]
Notation:  when $A$  is mapping reducible to $B$, we write $A  \leq_m B$.

{\bf Theorem} (Sipser 5.23): If $A \leq_m B$ and $A$ is undecidable, then $B$ is undecidable.
    

{\it Last time} we proved that $A_{TM} \le_m HALT_{TM}$ where
    \[
    HALT_{TM} = \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid \text{$M$ is a  Turing machine, $w$ is  a string, and $M$ halts on $w$} \}
    \]
and since $A_{TM}$ is undecidable, $HALT_{TM}$ is also undecidable. The function 
witnessing the mapping reduction mapped strings in $A_{TM}$ to strings in $HALT_{TM}$ and 
strings not in $A_{TM}$ to strings not in $HALT_{TM}$ by changing encoded Turing machines to 
ones that had identical computations except looped instead of rejecting.

\begin{comment}
Define $F: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$ by
    \[
    F(x) =  \begin{cases}
    const_{out} \qquad &\text{if  $x \neq \langle M,w \rangle$ for any Turing machine  $M$ and string  $w$ over the alphabet of $M$} \\
    \langle M', w \rangle \qquad &  \text{if $x = \langle M, w \rangle$ for some Turing machine  $M$ and string $w$ over the alphabet of $M$.}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    where $const_{out}  =  \langle  \includegraphics[width=1.5in]{Lect22TM1.png} ,  \varepsilon  \rangle$
    and  $M'$ is a Turing machine that computes like $M$ except, if the computation ever were to go to a  reject state,
    $M'$ loops instead.

Two models of computation are called {\bf equally expressive} when 
every language recognizable with the first model is recognizable with the second, and vice versa.

True / False: NFAs and PDAs are equally expressive.

True / False: Regular expressions and CFGs are equally expressive.


{\bf  Church-Turing Thesis} (Sipser p. 183): The informal notion of algorithm is formalized completely  and correctly by the 
formal definition of a  Turing machine. In other words: all reasonably expressive models of 
computation are equally expressive with the standard Turing machine.

The May-stay machine model is the same as the usual Turing machine model,  except that
on each transition, the tape head may move L, move R, or Stay. 

Formally: $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$ where 
\[
  \delta: Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R, S\}

{\bf Claim}: Turing machines and May-stay machines are equally expressive. {\it To prove \ldots}

To translate a standard TM to a may-stay machine: never use the direction $S$!


To translate one  of the  may-stay machines to standard TM:
any time TM would Stay, move right  then  left.

can be formally representated as

\fbox{ {\bf Enumerators} } Enumerators give a different
model of computation where a language is {\bf produced, one string at a time},
rather than recognized by accepting (or not) individual strings.

Each enumerator machine has finite state control, unlimited work tape, and a printer. The computation proceeds
according to transition function; at any point machine may ``send'' a string to the printer.
\[
E  = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{print})

$Q$ is the finite set of states, $\Sigma$ is  the output alphabet, $\Gamma$ is the 
tape alphabet ($\Sigma  \subsetneq\Gamma, 
\textvisiblespace \in \Gamma \setminus \Sigma$), 
\[
\delta:  Q  \times  \Gamma \times \Gamma \to  Q \times  \Gamma \times  \Gamma \times \{L, R\} \times  \{L, R\}
\]
where in state $q$, when the working tape is scanning character $x$ and the printer tape is scanning character $y$,
$\delta( (q,x,y) ) = (q', x', y', d_w, d_p)$ means transition to control state $q'$, write $x'$ on 
the working tape, write $y'$ on the printer tape, move in direction $d_w$ on the working tape, and move in direction 
$d_p$ on the printer tape. The computation starts in $q_0$ and each time the computation enters $q_{print}$
the string from the leftmost edge of the printer tape to the first blank cell is considered to be printed.

The language  {\bf  enumerated} by  $E$, $L(E)$, is $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \text{$E$ eventually, at finite  time, 
prints $w$} \}$.

{\bf Theorem 3.21} A language is Turing-recognizable iff some enumerator enumerates it.

{\bf Proof, part 1}: Assume $L$ is enumerated by some enumerator, $E$, so $L = L(E)$. We'll use $E$ in a subroutine
within a high-level description of a new Turing machine that we will build to recognize $L$.

{\bf Goal}: build Turing machine $M_E$ with $L(M_E) = L(E)$.

Define $M_E$ as follows: $M_E = $ ``On input $w$,
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run $E$. For each string $x$ printed by $E$.
\item \qquad Check if $x = w$. If so, accept (and halt); otherwise, continue."
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Proof, part 2}: Assume $L$ is Turing-recognizable and there 
is a Turing  machine  $M$ with  $L = L(M)$. We'll use $M$ in a subroutine
within a high-level description of an enumerator that we will build to enumerate $L$.

{\bf Goal}: build enumerator $E_M$ with $L(E_M) = L(M)$.

{\bf Idea}: check each string in turn to see if it is in $L$.

{\it How?} Run computation of $M$ on each string.  {\it But}: need to be careful 
about computations that don't halt.

{\it Recall} String order for $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$: $s_1 = \varepsilon$, $s_2 = 0$, $s_3 = 1$, $s_4 = 00$, $s_5 = 01$, $s_6  = 10$, 
$s_7  =  11$, $s_8 = 000$, \ldots

Define $E_M$ as follows: $E_{M} = $ `` {\it ignore any input.} Repeat the following for $i=1, 2, 3, \ldots$
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Run the computations of $M$ on $s_1$, $s_2$, \ldots, $s_i$ for (at most) $i$ steps each
  \item For each of these $i$ computations that accept during the (at most) $i$ steps, print
  out the accepted string."
\end{enumerate}

\vfill

\fbox{ {\bf Nondeterministic Turing machine}}

At any point in the computation, the nondeterministic machine may proceed according to 
several possibilities: $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{acc}, q_{rej})$ where 
\[
\delta: Q \times \Gamma \to \mathcal{P}(Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\})  
\]
The computation of a nondeterministic Turing machine is a tree with branching
when the next step of the computation has multiple possibilities. A nondeterministic
Turing machine accepts a string exactly when some branch of the computation tree 
enters the accept state.

Given a nondeterministic machine, we can use a $3$-tape Turing machine to 
simulate it by doing a breadth-first search of computation tree: one tape 
is ``read-only'' input tape, one tape simulates the tape of the nondeterministic
computation, and one tape tracks nondeterministic branching. {\tiny Sipser page 178} 

\vfill

{\bf Summary}

Two models of computation are called {\bf equally expressive} when 
every language recognizable with the first model is recognizable with the second, and vice versa.

To prove the existence of a Turing machine that decides / recognizes some language, 
it's enough to construct an example using any of the equally expressive models.

But: some of the {\bf performance} properties of these models are not equivalent.

    To prove that a computational problem is {\bf decidable}, we find/ build a Turing 
    machine that recognizes the language encoding the computational problem, and that 
    is a decider.
    
    
    How do we prove a specific problem is {\bf not decidable}?
    
    How would we even find such a computational problem?
    
    
    {\it Counting arguments for the existence of an undecidable language:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The set of all Turing machines is countably infinite.
        \item Each recognizable language has at least one Turing machine that recognizes it (by definition), 
        so there can be no more Turing-recognizable
        languages than there are Turing machines. 
        \item Since there are infinitely many Turing-recognizable languages
        (think of the singleton sets), there are countably infinitely 
        many Turing-recognizable languages.
        \item Such the set of Turing-decidable languages is an infinite subset 
        of the set of Turing-recognizable languages, the set of 
        Turing-decidable languages is also countably infinite.
    \end{itemize}
    
    Since there are uncountably many languages (because $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma^*)$
    is uncountable), there are uncountably many unrecognizable languages
    and there are uncountably many undecidable languages.
    
    
    Thus, there's at least one undecidable language!
    
    \vfill
    
    {\bf What's a specific example of a language that is unrecognizable or undecidable?}
    
    To prove that a language is undecidable, we need to prove that there is no Turing machine that decides it.
    
    {\bf Key idea}: proof by contradiction relying on self-referential disagreement.
    
    

{\bf  Theorem}: $A_{TM}$  is  not  Turing-decidable.

{\bf  Proof}: Suppose {\bf towards a  contradiction}  that there  is a Turing machine  that decides $A_{TM}$.  
We call this presumed machine  $M_{ATM}$.

By  assumption, for every  Turing machine  $M$ and every  string $w$

\begin{itemize}
\item If $w \in L(M)$, then  the computation of $M_{ATM}$  on  $\langle M,w \rangle ~~ \underline{\phantom{\hspace{2.5in}}}$
\item If $w \notin L(M)$, then  the computation of $M_{ATM}$  on  $\langle M,w \rangle ~~ \underline{\phantom{\hspace{2.5in}}}$

Can we relate the decidability / undecidability of one problem to another?

``Can answer questions about membership in $X$ by converting them to questions about membership in $Y$''.

{\bf The Church-Turing thesis posits that each algorithm can be implemented by some Turing machine.}

{\bf Describing  algorithms} (Sipser p. 185) To define a Turing machine, we could give a 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Formal definition}: the $7$-tuple of parameters including set of states, 
input alphabet, tape alphabet, transition function, start state, accept state, and reject state.
This is the low-level programming view that models the logic computation flow in a processor.
\item {\bf Implementation-level definition}: English prose that describes the Turing machine head 
movements relative to contents of tape, and conditions for accepting / rejecting based on those contents.
This level describes memory management and implementing data access with data structures.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mention the tape or its contents (e.g.\ ``Scan the tape from left to right until a blank is seen.'')
    \item Mention the tape head (e.g.\ ``Return the tape head to the left end of the tape.'')
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf High-level description} of algorithm executed by Turing machine: 
description of algorithm (precise sequence of instructions), 
without implementation details of machine. 
High-level descriptions of  Turing machine algorithms are written as indented text within quotation marks.   
Stages of the algorithm are typically numbered consecutively.
The first line specifies the input to the machine, which must be a string.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use other Turing machines as subroutines (e.g.\ ``Run $M$ on $w$'')
    \item Build new machines from existing machines using previously shown results (e.g.\ 
    ``Given NFA $A$ construct an NFA $B$ such that $L(B) = \overline{L(A)}$'')
    \item Use previously shown conversions and constructions (e.g.\ ``Convert regular expression $R$ 
    to an NFA $N$'')
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Formatted inputs to Turing machine algorithms}

The input to a Turing machine is always a string. 
The format of the input to a Turing machine can be checked to interpret 
this string as representing structured data (like a csv file, the formal definition of a DFA, another Turing machine, etc.)


This string may be the encoding of some object or  list of  objects.  

{\bf Notation:} $\langle O \rangle$ is the string that encodes the object $O$.
$\langle O_1, \ldots, O_n \rangle$ is the string that encodes the list of objects $O_1, \ldots, O_n$.

{\bf Assumption}: There are algorithms (Turing  machines) that can be called as subroutines
to decode the string representations of common objects and  interact with these objects as intended
(data structures). These algorithms are able to ``type-check'' and string representations for different
data structures are unique.
  
\newpage
For example, since there are algorithms to answer each of the following questions,
by Church-Turing thesis, there is a Turing machine that accepts exactly those strings for which the 
answer to the question is ``yes''
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does a string over $\{0,1\}$ have even length?

    \item Does a string over $\{0,1\}$ encode a string of ASCII characters?\footnote{An introduction to ASCII 
    is available on the w3 tutorial \href{https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp}{here}.}

    \item Does a DFA have a specific number of states?

    \item Do two NFAs have any state names in common?

    \item Do two CFGs have the same start variable?

  \end{itemize}



A {\bf computational problem} is decidable iff language encoding its positive problem instances
is decidable.

The computational problem ``Does a specific DFA accept a given string?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of DFAs $M$ and strings $w$ such that $w \in L(M)$}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle M, w \rangle \mid M \textrm{ is a DFA}, w \textrm{ is a string}, w \in L(M) \}
\end{align*}

The computational problem ``Is the language generated by a CFG empty?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of CFGs $G$  such that $L(G) = \emptyset$}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle G \rangle \mid G \textrm{ is a CFG},  L(G) = \emptyset \}
\end{align*}



The computational problem ``Is the given Turing machine a decider?'' is encoded by the language
\begin{align*}
  &\{ \textrm{representations of TMs $M$  such that $M$ halts on every input}\}  \\
  =& \{ \langle M \rangle \mid M \textrm{ is a TM and for each string } w, \textrm{$M$ halts on $w$} \}
\end{align*}


{\it Note: writing down the language encoding a computational problem is only the first step in 
determining if it's recognizable, decidable, or \ldots }

Deciding a computational problem means building / defining a Turing 
machine that recognizes the language encoding the computational problem, and that 
is a decider.

  of states in a state diagram, counting the number of characters in an alphabet, converting DFA
  to a DFA recognizing the complement of the original language or a DFA recognizing the 
  Kleene star of the original language, constructing a DFA or NFA from two DFA or NFA so that 
  we have a machine recognizing the language of the union (or intersection, concatenation)
  of the languages of the original machines; converting regular expressions to equivalent DFA;

In practice, computers (and Turing machines) don't have infinite tape, 
and we can't afford to wait unboundedly long for an answer.
``Decidable" isn't good enough - we want ``Efficiently decidable".

For a given algorithm working on a given input, how long do we need to wait for an answer? 
How does the running time depend on the input in the worst-case? average-case? 
We expect to have to spend more time on computations with larger inputs.

Million-dollar question: Is $P = NP$?


One approach to trying to answer it is to look for {\it hardest} problems in $NP$ and 
then (1) if we can show that there are efficient algorithms for them, then we can get 
efficient algorithms for all problems in $NP$ so $P = NP$, or (2) these problems might 
be good candidates for showing that there are problems in $NP$ for which there 
are no efficient algorithms.

Definition (Sipser 7.29) Language  $A$ is {\bf polynomial-time mapping reducible} to language $B$, written $A \leq_P B$,
means there is a polynomial-time computable function $f: \Sigma^* \to \Sigma^*$  such that for every $x \in \Sigma^*$
\[
x \in A \qquad \text{iff} \qquad f(x) \in B.
\]
The  function $f$ is  called the  polynomial time reduction of $A$ to $B$.

{\bf  Theorem}  (Sipser 7.31):  If $A \leq_P B$ and $B  \in P$ then $A \in P$.

Proof: 

\vfill

Definition (Sipser 7.34; based in Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin's work in the 1970s): 
A language $B$ is {\bf  NP-complete} means (1) $B$ is in NP {\bf and}  (2) every language
$A$ in $NP$ is polynomial time reducible to $B$.

{\bf  Theorem}  (Sipser 7.35):  If $B$ is NP-complete and $B \in P$ then $P = NP$.

Proof:

{\bf 3SAT}: A literal is a Boolean variable (e.g.  $x$) or a negated Boolean variable (e.g.  $\bar{x}$).  
A Boolean formula is a {\bf  3cnf-formula} if it is a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (a conjunction  
of  disjunctive clauses of literals) and each clause  has  three literals.
\[
3SAT  = \{  \langle  \phi \rangle \mid \text{$\phi$ is  a  satisfiable 3cnf-formula} \}
\]


Example string  in $3SAT$
\[
   \langle (x \vee \bar{y} \vee {\bar z}) \wedge (\bar{x}  \vee y  \vee  z) \wedge (x \vee y  \vee z) \rangle
\]



Example  string not  in $3SAT$
\[
   \langle (x \vee y \vee z) \wedge 
    (x \vee y \vee{\bar z}) \wedge
    (x \vee \bar{y} \vee z) \wedge
    (x \vee \bar{y} \vee \bar{z}) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee y \vee z) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee y \vee{\bar z}) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee \bar{y} \vee z) \wedge
    (\bar{x} \vee \bar{y} \vee \bar{z}) \rangle
\]



{\bf Cook-Levin Theorem}: $3SAT$ is $NP$-complete.


{\it Are there other $NP$-complete problems?} To prove that $X$ is $NP$-complete
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it From scratch}: prove $X$ is in $NP$ and that all $NP$ problems are polynomial-time
reducible to $X$.
\item {\it Using reduction}: prove $X$ is in $NP$ and that a known-to-be $NP$-complete problem 
is polynomial-time reducible to $X$.

{\bf CLIQUE}: A {\bf $k$-clique} in an undirected graph is a maximally connected subgraph with $k$  nodes.

CLIQUE  = \{  \langle G, k \rangle \mid \text{$G$ is an  undirected graph with  a $k$-clique} \}

Theorem (Sipser 7.32):
\[
3SAT  \leq_P CLIQUE
\]

Given a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form with $k$ clauses and three literals per clause, we will 
map it to a graph so that the graph has a clique if the original formula is satisfiable and the 
graph does not have a clique if the original formula is not satisfiable.

The graph has $3k$ vertices (one for each literal in each clause) and an edge between all vertices except
\begin{itemize}
    \item vertices for two literals in the same clause
    \item vertices for literals that are negations of one another
\end{itemize}

Example: $(x \vee \bar{y} \vee {\bar z}) \wedge (\bar{x}  \vee y  \vee  z) \wedge (x \vee y  \vee z)$
