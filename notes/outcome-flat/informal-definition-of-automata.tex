Warmup:   Design a CFG to generate the  language $\{a^i b^j \mid j \geq i  \geq 0\}$

Design a PDA to recognize the  language $\{a^i b^j \mid j \geq i  \geq 0\}$
  
\vspace{100pt}


\vfill
\newpage

{\bf Theorem  2.20}: A language is  generated by some context-free  grammar
if  and only if it is recognized by some push-down automaton.

Definition: a language is called {\bf context-free} if it is the language generated by a context-free grammar.
The class of all context-free language over a given alphabet $\Sigma$ is called {\bf CFL}.

Consequences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quick proof that every regular language is context free 
    \item To prove closure of the class of context-free languages under a given operation, we can choose 
    either of two modes 
    of proof (via CFGs or PDAs) depending on which is easier
    \item To fully specify a PDA we could give its $6$-tuple formal definition or we could give its input 
alphabet, stack alphabet, and state diagram.
An informal description of a PDA is a step-by-step description of how its computations 
would process input strings; the reader should be able to reconstruct the state diagram or formal 
definition precisely from such a descripton. The informal description of a PDA can refer to some 
common modules or subroutines that are computable by PDAs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item PDAs can ``test for emptiness of stack'' without providing details. 
  {\it How?} We can always push a special end-of-stack symbol, $\$$, at the start, before processing
  any input, and then use this symbol as a flag.
  \item PDAs can ``test for end of input'' without providing details.
  {\it How?} We can transform a PDA to one where accepting states are only those reachable 
  when there are no more input symbols.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\newpage
Suppose $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free languages over $\Sigma$.  {\bf Goal}:  $L_1 \cup L_2$  is  also context-free.

{\it Approach 1: with  PDAs}

Let $M_1 = ( Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and
$M_2 = ( Q_2, \Sigma, \Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)$ be PDAs with 
$L(M_1) =  L_1$  and  $L(M_2) = L_2$.

Define $M = $

{\it Approach  2: with CFGs}

Let $G_1 = (V_1, \Sigma, R_1, S_1)$  and   $G_2 = (V_2, \Sigma, R_2, S_2)$  be CFGs  with
$L(G_1) =  L_1$  and  $L(G_2) = L_2$.

{\it Summary}

Over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ is {\bf regular}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{center}
    iff it is described by some regular expression \\
    iff it is recognized by some DFA\\
    iff it is recognized by some NFA
\end{center}

Over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, a language $L$ is {\bf context-free}

\vspace{-20pt}
\begin{center}
    iff it is generated by some CFG\\
    iff it is recognized by some PDA
\end{center}

{\bf Fact}: Every regular language is a context-free language.

{\bf Fact}: There are context-free languages that are not nonregular.

{\bf Fact}: There are countably many regular languages.

{\bf Fact}: There are countably inifnitely many context-free languages.

{\it Consequence}: Most languages are {\bf not} context-free!

{\bf Examples  of non-context-free languages}

\begin{align*}
    &\{ a^n b^n c^n \mid 0 \leq n , n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\{ a^i b^j c^k \mid 0 \leq i \leq j \leq k , i \in \mathbb{Z}, j \in \mathbb{Z}, k \in \mathbb{Z}\}\\
    &\{ ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^* \}
\end{align*}
(Sipser Ex 2.36, Ex 2.37, 2.38)

There is a Pumping Lemma for CFL that can be used to prove a specific language is non-context-free: 
If $A$ is a context-free language, there there
is a number $p$ where, if $s$ is any string in $A$ of length at least $p$, then $s$ may be divided 
into five pieces $s = uvxyz$ where (1) for each $i \geq 0$, $uv^ixy^iz \in A$, (2) $|uv|>0$, (3) $|vxy| \leq p$.
{\it We will not go into the details of the proof or application of Pumping Lemma for CFLs this quarter.}

Regular sets are not the end of the story
\begin{itemize}
    \item Many nice / simple / important sets are not regular
    \item Limitation of the finite-state automaton model: Can't ``count", Can only remember finitely far into the past,
    Can't backtrack, Must make decisions in ``real-time"
    \item We know actual computers are more powerful than this model...
\end{itemize}

The {\bf next} model of computation. Idea: allow some memory of unbounded size. How? 
\begin{itemize}
    \item To generalize regular expressions: {\bf context-free grammars}\\
    \item To generalize NFA: {\bf Pushdown automata}, which is like an NFA with access to a stack: 
    Number of states is fixed, number of entries in stack is unbounded. At each step
    (1) Transition to new state based on current state, letter read, and top letter of stack, then
    (2) (Possibly) push or pop a letter to (or from) top of stack. Accept a string iff
    there is some sequence of states and some sequence of stack contents 
    which helps the PDA processes the entire input string and ends in an accepting state.
\end{itemize}

Is there a PDA that recognizes the nonregular language $\{0^n1^n \mid n \geq 0 \}$?

The PDA with state diagram above can be informally described as:
\begin{quote}
    Read symbols from the input. As each 0 is read, push it onto the stack. 
    As soon as 1s are seen, pop a 0 off the stack for each 1 read. 
    If the stack becomes empty and we are at the end of the input string, accept the input. 
    If the stack becomes empty and there are 1s left to read, 
    or if 1s are finished while the stack still contains 0s, or if any 0s
    appear in the string following 1s, 
    reject the input.
\end{quote}
    

Trace the computation of this PDA on the input string $01$.

A PDA recognizing the set $\{ \hspace{1.5 in} \}$ can be informally described as:

    As soon as 1s are seen, pop a 0 off the stack for each 1 read. 
    If the stack becomes empty and there is exactly one 1 left to read, read that 1 and accept the input. 
    If the stack becomes empty and there are either zero or more than one 1s left to read, 
    or if the 1s are finished while the stack still contains 0s, or if any 0s appear in the input following 1s, 
    reject the input.

How does the meaning change if $a$ is replaced by $\varepsilon$?
\end{comment}


{\it Big picture}: PDAs were motivated by wanting to add some memory of unbounded size to NFA. How 
do we accomplish a similar enhancement of regular expressions to get a syntactic model that is 
more expressive?

DFA, NFA, PDA: Machines process one input string at a time; the computation of a machine on its input string 
reads the input from left to right.

Regular expressions: Syntactic descriptions of all strings that match a particular pattern; the language 
described by a regular expression is built up recursively according to the expression's syntax

{\bf Context-free grammars}: Rules to produce one string at a time, adding characters from the middle, beginning, 
or end of the final string as the derivation proceeds.

 \vfill
\section*{Week6 monday}


We are ready to introduce a formal model that will capture a notion of general purpose computation.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Similar to DFA, NFA, PDA}: input will be an arbitrary string over a fixed alphabet.
\item {\it Different from NFA, PDA}: machine is deterministic.
\item {\it Different from DFA, NFA, PDA}: read-write head can move both to the left and to the right,
and can extend to the right past the original input.
\item {\it Similar to DFA, NFA, PDA}: transition function drives computation one step at a time 
by moving within a finite set of states, always starting at designated start state.
\item {\it Different from DFA, NFA, PDA}: the special states for rejecting and accepting take effect immediately.
\end{itemize}

Formally: a  Turing machine is $M= (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject})$ 
where $\delta$ is the {\bf transition function} 
\[
  \delta: Q\times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}
\]
The {\bf computation} of $M$ on a string $w$ over $\Sigma$  is:

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Read/write head starts at leftmost position on tape. 
\item Input string is written on $|w|$-many leftmost cells of tape, 
rest of  the tape cells have  the blank symbol. {\bf Tape alphabet} 
is $\Gamma$ with $\textvisiblespace\in \Gamma$ and $\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma$.
The blank symbol $\textvisiblespace \notin \Sigma$.
\item Given current state of machine and current symbol being read at the tape head, 
the machine transitions to next state, writes a symbol to the current position  of the 
tape  head (overwriting existing symbol), and moves the tape head L or R (if possible). 
\item Computation ends {\bf if and when} machine enters either the accept or the reject state.
This is called {\bf halting}.
Note: $q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}$.
\end{itemize}

The {\bf language recognized by the  Turing machine} $M$,  is  $L(M) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \textrm{ is accepted by } M\}$,
which is defined as
\[
  \{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \textrm{computation of $M$ on $w$ halts after entering the accept state}\}

A {\bf Turing-recognizable} language is a set of strings that 
is the language recognized by some Turing machine. We also 
say that such languages are recognizable.

A {\bf Turing-decidable} language is a set of strings that 
is the language recognized by some decider. We also 
say that such languages are decidable.


An {\bf unrecognizable} language is a language that is not Turing-recognizable.

An {\bf undecidable} language is a language that is not Turing-decidable.

{\bf  Church-Turing Thesis} (Sipser p. 183): The informal notion of algorithm is formalized completely  and correctly by the

Definition: A language $L$ over an  alphabet $\Sigma$ is called {\bf co-recognizable} if its complement,  defined
as $\Sigma^* \setminus L  = \{ x  \in  \Sigma^* \mid x \notin  L \}$, is Turing-recognizable.


\vfill 
{\bf  Theorem} (Sipser Theorem 4.22): A  language is Turing-decidable if and only if both  it and its complement
are Turing-recognizable.

{\bf Proof, first direction:}  Suppose  language  $L$ is  Turing-decidable.   WTS  that both it and its complement 
are Turing-recognizable.

{\bf Warmup}: Design a DFA (deterministic finite automaton) and an NFA (nondeterministic
finite automaton) that each recognize each of the following languages over $\{a,b\}$
\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ and ends in $b$}\}
\]

\vfill

\[
    \{ w \mid \text{$w$ has an $a$ or ends in $b$}\}

\textbf{Strategy}: To design DFA or NFA for a given language,  
identify patterns that can be built up as we process strings and create states
for intermediate stages. Or: decompose the language to a simpler one 
that we already know how to recognize with a DFA or NFA.


{\it Recall} (from Wednesday of last week, and in textbook Exercise 1.14): 
if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.


Let's practice defining automata constructions by coming up with other ways to get new automata from old.

{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \cup A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Use nondeterminism to choose which of $N_1$, $N_2$ to run.

{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$
and assume $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$ and that $q_0 \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2$.
Construct $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q = $
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is defined by, for $q \in Q$ and $x \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:

So far we have that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a DFA recognizing a language, there is a DFA recognizing its complement.
\item If there are NFA recognizing two languages, there is a NFA recognizing their union.
\item If there are DFA recognizing two languages, there is a DFA recognizing their union.
\item If there are DFA recognizing two languages, there is a DFA recognizing their intersection.
\end{itemize}

Our goals for today are (1) prove similar results about other set operations, (2) prove that 
NFA and DFA are equally expressive, and therefore (3) define an important class of languages.

Suppose $A_1, A_2$ are languages over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N_1$ such that $L(N_1) = A_1$ and 
NFA $N_2$ such that $L(N_2) = A_2$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A_1 \circ A_2$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Allow computation to move between $N_1$ and $N_2$ ``spontaneously" when reach an accepting state of 
$N_1$, guessing that we've reached the point where the two parts of the string in the set-wise concatenation 
are glued together.


{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and $N_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2,q_2, F_2)$
and assume $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$.
Construct $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q = $
    \item $q_0 = $
    \item $F = $
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \to \mathcal{P}(Q)$ is defined by, for $q \in Q$ and $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$:
        \[
            \delta((q,a))=\begin{cases}  
                \delta_1 ((q,a)) &\qquad\text{if } q\in Q_1 \textrm{ and } q \notin F_1\\

the first in $A_1$ and the second in $A_2$; then, taking an arbitrary

Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N$ such that $L(N) = A$, then there is another NFA, let's call it $N'$, such that 
$L(N') = A^*$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Add a fresh start state, which is an accept state. Add spontaneous 
moves from each (old) accept state to the old start state.

{\bf Formal construction}: Let 
$N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_1, F)$ and assume $q_0 \notin Q$.
Construct $N' = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', q_0, F')$ where
\begin{itemize}

Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a NFA $N$ such that $L(N) = A$ then 
there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$.

{\bf Proof idea}: States in $M$ are ``macro-states" -- collections of states from $N$ -- 
that represent the set of possible states a computation of $N$ might be in.


{\bf Formal construction}: Let $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.  Define 
\[
M = (~ \mathcal{P}(Q), \Sigma, \delta', q',  \{ X \subseteq Q \mid X \cap F \neq \emptyset \}~ )

where $q' = \{ q \in Q \mid \text{$q = q_0$ or is accessible from $q_0$ by spontaneous moves in $N$} \}$
and 
\[
    \delta' (~(X, x)~) = \{ q \in Q \mid q \in \delta( ~(r,x)~) ~\text{for some $r \in X$ or is accessible 
from such an $r$ by spontaneous moves in $N$} \}

{\bf The class of regular languages}

Fix an alphabet $\Sigma$. For each language $L$ over $\Sigma$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
    {\bf There is a DFA over $\Sigma$ that recognizes $L$}&$\exists M ~(M \textrm{ is a DFA and } L(M) = A)$\\
    {\it if and only if}&\\
    {\bf There is a NFA over $\Sigma$ that recognizes $L$}&$\exists N ~(N \textrm{ is a NFA and } L(N) = A)$\\
    {\it if and only if}&\\
    {\bf There is a regular expression over $\Sigma$ that describes $L$} &$\exists R ~(R \textrm{ is a regular expression and } L(R) = A)$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

A language is called {\bf regular} when any (hence all) of the above three conditions are met.

We already proved that DFAs and NFAs are equally expressive. It remains to prove that regular expressions 
are too.

Part 1: Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
If there is a regular expression $R$ such that $L(R) = A$, then there is a NFA, let's call it $N$, such that 
$L(N) = A$.

{\bf Structural induction}: Regular expression is built from basis regular expressions using inductive steps
(union, concatenation, Kleene star symbols). Use constructions to mirror these in NFAs.


{\bf Application}: A state diagram for a NFA over $\{a,b\}$ that recognizes $L(a^* (ab)^*)$:

\vfill

Part 2: Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$.
If there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$, then there is a regular expression, let's call it $R$, such that 
$L(R) = A$.

{\bf Proof idea}: Trace all possible paths from start state to accept state.  Express labels of these paths
as regular expressions, and union them all.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add new start state with $\varepsilon$ arrow to old start state.
\item Add new accept state with $\varepsilon$ arrow from old accept states.  Make old accept states
non-accept.
\item Remove one (of the old) states at a time: modify regular expressions on arrows that went through removed
state to restore language recognized by machine.
\end{enumerate}

Give two examples of strings that are accepted by $M$ and two examples of strings that are rejected by $M$:

Let the alphabet be $\Sigma_1 = \{0,1\}$.

A state diagram for a finite automaton that recognizes $\{w \in \Sigma_1^* \mid w~\text{contains at most two $1$'s} \}$ is

\vfill

A state diagram for a finite automaton that recognizes $\{w \in \Sigma_1^* \mid w~\text{contains more than two $1$'s} \}$ is

\vfill

\textbf{Strategy}: Add ``labels" for states in the state diagram, e.g. 
``have not seen any of desired pattern yet'' or ``sink state''.
Then, we can use the analysis of the roles of the states in the state diagram to work towards a 
description of the language recognized by the finite automaton. 

\vfill
A useful bit of terminology: the {\bf iterated transition function} of a finite automaton
$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ is defined recursively by
\[
\delta^* (~(q,w)~) 
=\begin{cases}
q  \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q, w = \varepsilon$} \\
\delta( ~(q,a)~) \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q$, $w = a \in \Sigma$ } \\
\delta(~(\delta^*(q,u), a) ~) \qquad &\text{if $q \in Q$, $w = ua$ where $u \in  \Sigma^*$ and $a \in \Sigma$}
\end{cases}
\]

Using  this terminology, $M$ accepts a string $w$ over $\Sigma$ if and only if $\delta^*( ~(q_0,w)~) \in F$.

\newpage
Suppose $A$ is a language over an alphabet $\Sigma$. By definition, this means $A$ is a subset of $\Sigma^*$.
{\bf Claim:} if there is a DFA $M$ such that $L(M) = A$ then there is another DFA, let's call it $M'$, such that 
$L(M') = \overline{A}$, the complement of $A$, defined as $\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid w \notin A \}$.

{\bf Proof idea}:


{\bf Proof}: 




\vfill

Application: Design a finite automaton that recognizes the language of all strings over $\{a,b\}$
whose length is not a multiple of $3$.

{\bf Note}: On Friday, we'll see a new kind of finite automaton. It will be helpful to distinguish it from the
machines we've been talking about so we'll use {\bf Deterministic Finite Automaton} (DFA) to refer to the machines 
from Section 1.1. \vfill

the empty string (and potentially other strings too).

{\bf Review}: Determine whether each statement below about regular expressions
over the alphabet $\{a,b,c\}$ is true or false:

\begin{comment}
True or False: \qquad 
   $a  \in L(~(a \cup b )~\cup c)$
\end{comment}

True or False: \qquad 
   $ab  \in L(~ (a \cup b)^*  ~)$
   
True or False: \qquad    
   $ba \in L( ~ a^* b^* ~)$
   
True or False: \qquad 
   $\varepsilon  \in L(a \cup b \cup c)$
   
True or False: \qquad 
   $\varepsilon  \in L(~ (a \cup b)^*  ~)$

True or False: \qquad 
   $\varepsilon \in L( ~ aa^* \cup bb^* ~)$


**This definition was in the pre-class reading**
A finite automaton (FA) is specified by  $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$.
This $5$-tuple is called the {\bf formal definition} of the FA. The FA can also 
be represented by its state diagram: with nodes for the state, labelled edges specifying the 
transition function, and decorations on nodes denoting the start and accept states.

\begin{quote}
Finite set of states $Q$ can be labelled by any collection of distinct names. Often
we use default state labels $q0, q1, \ldots$ 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}  
The alphabet $\Sigma$ determines the possible inputs to the automaton. 
Each input to the automaton is a string over  $\Sigma$, and the automaton ``processes'' the input
one symbol (or character) at a time.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The transition function $\delta$ gives the next state of the automaton based on the current state of 
the machine and on the next input symbol.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The start state $q_0$ is an element of $Q$.  Each computation of the machine starts at the  start  state.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The accept (final) states $F$ form a subset of the states of the automaton, $F \subseteq  Q$. 
These states are used to flag if the machine accepts or rejects an input string.
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
The computation of a machine on an input string is a sequence of states
in the machine,  starting with the start state, determined by transitions 
of the machine as it reads successive input symbols.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The finite automaton $M$ accepts the given input string exactly when the computation of $M$ on the input string
ends in an accept state. $M$ rejects the given input string exactly when the computation of 
$M$ on the input string ends in a nonaccept state, that is, a state that is not in $F$.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote} 
The language of $M$, $L(M)$, is defined as the set of  all strings that are each accepted 
by the machine $M$. Each string that is rejected by $M$ is not in $L(M)$.
The language of $M$ is also called the language recognized by $M$.
