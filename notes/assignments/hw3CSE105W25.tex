\item \textbf{Static analysis} (10 points):
In software engineering, static analysis is an approach to debugging and testing where the properties of a piece of code are inferred without actually running it.  
In the context of finite automata, we can think of static analysis as the process of inferring properties of the language recognized by 
a finite automaton from properties of the graph underlying its state diagram. The Pumping Lemma is one example of static analysis.
In this question, you'll explore other examples of how properties of the 
graph underlying the state diagram of a machine can give us information about 
the language recognized by the machine.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeCompleteFirst Suppose you are given an NFA $N_0$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ and each accepting state in $N_0$ is not reachable from the start state of $N_0$.  What can you conclude about the language of the NFA?

\item\gradeCorrectFirst Prove or disprove: For any alphabet $\Sigma$ and any  DFA $M$ over $\Sigma$, if every state in $M$ is accepting then $L(M) = \Sigma^*$. A complete answer will clearly indicate whether the statement is true or false and then will justify with a complete and correct argument.

\item\gradeCorrect Prove or disprove: For any alphabet $\Sigma$ and any  NFA $N$ over $\Sigma$, if every state in $N$ is accepting then $L(N) = \Sigma^*$. A complete answer will clearly indicate whether the statement is true or false and then will justify with a complete and correct argument.

\item \textbf{Multiple representations} (12 points):

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Consider the language $A_1 = \{ uw \mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}$
   and the following argument.

   \begin{quote}
      ``Proof" that $A_1$ is not regular using the Pumping Lemma: Let $p$ be 
      an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_1$. 
      
      Choose $s$ to be the string $1^p 0^p$, which is in $A_1$ because
      we can choose $u = 1^p$ and $w = 0^p$ which each have length $p$.
      Since $s$ is in $A_1$ and has length greater than or equal to $p$, if $p$ were to be a
      pumping length for $A_1$, $s$ ought to be pump'able. 
      That is, there should be a way of dividing $s$ into parts $x,y,z$ where $s=xyz$,
      $|y| >0$, $|xy| \leq p$, and for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A_1$.
      Suppose $x,y,z$ are such that $s = xyz$, $|y| > 0$ and $|xy| \leq p$.
      Since the first $p$ letters of $s$ are all $1$ and $|xy| \leq p$, we know
      that $x$ and $y$ are made up of all $1$s.  If we let $i=2$, we get 
      a string $xy^iz$ that is not in $A_1$ because repeating $y$ twice adds $1$s to 
      $u$ but not to $w$, and strings in $A_1$ are required to have $u$ and $w$ be the same
      length. Thus, $s$ is not pumpable (even though it should have been if $p$ were to be a pumping length)
      and so $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_1$.  Since $p$ was arbitrary, we have
      demonstrated that $A_1$ has no pumping length.  By the Pumping Lemma, this implies that 
      $A_1$ is nonregular.
      \end{quote}
      \begin{enumerate}
         \item \gradeComplete Find the (first and/or most significant) logical error in the ``proof" above 
         and describe why it's wrong.
   
         \item \gradeComplete Prove that the set $A_1$ is actually regular (by finding a regular expression that describes it or 
         a DFA/NFA that recognizes it, and justifying why) {\bf or} fix the proof so that it is logically sound.     
      \end{enumerate}

   \item Consider the language $A_2 = \{ u1w \mid \text{$u$ and
   $w$ are strings over $\{0,1\}$ and have the same length} \}$
   and the following argument.


   \begin{quote}
      ``Proof" that $A_2$ is not regular using the Pumping Lemma: Let $p$ be 
      an arbitrary positive integer. We will show that $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_2$. 
      
      Choose $s$ to be the string $1^{p+1} 0^{p}$, which is in $A_2$ because
      we can choose $u = 1^p$ and $w = 0^p$ which each have length $p$.
      Since $s$ is in $A_2$ and has length greater than or equal to $p$, if $p$ were to be a
      pumping length for $A_2$, $s$ ought to be pump'able. 
      That is, there should be a way of dividing $s$ into parts $x,y,z$ where $s=xyz$,
      $|y| >0$, $|xy| \leq p$, and for each $i \geq 0$, $xy^iz \in A_2$.
      When $x = \varepsilon$ and $y = 1^{p+1}$ and $z = 0^{p}$,
      we have satisfied that $s = xyz$, $|y| > 0$ (because $p$ is positive) and $|xy| \leq p$.
      If we let $i=0$, we get 
      the string $xy^iz = 0^{p}$ that is not in $A_2$ because its middle symbol is a $0$, not a $1$. 
      Thus, $s$ is not pumpable (even though it should have been if $p$ were to be a pumping length)
      and so $p$ is not a pumping length for $A_2$.  Since $p$ was arbitrary, we have
      demonstrated that $A_2$ has no pumping length.  By the Pumping Lemma, this implies that 
      $A_2$ is nonregular.
      \end{quote}

      \begin{enumerate}

      \item \gradeComplete Find the (first and/or most significant) logical error in the ``proof" above 
      and describe why it's wrong.

      \item \gradeComplete Prove that the set $A_2$ is actually regular (by finding a regular expression that describes it or

\item \textbf{Pumping} (10 points):

\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeCorrect Give an example of a language
over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$ that has cardinality $3$ and for which $5$ is a pumping length
and $4$ is not a pumping length. Is this language regular? A complete solution will give 
(1) a clear and precise
description of the language, (2) a justification for why $5$ is a pumping length, (3) a 
justification for why $4$ is not a pumping length, (4) a correct and justified answer to 
whether the language is regular.


\item\gradeComplete In class and in the reading so far, we've seen the following examples of nonregular sets:
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{center}
$\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 0 \}$
$$\{ 0^n 1^n ~|~ n \geq 2 \}$$
$$\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~  0 \leq n \leq m \}$$
$$\{ 0^n 1^m ~|~ 0 \leq m \leq n \}$$
$$\{ 0^i 1^{2i} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}$$
$$\{ 0^i 1^{i+1} ~|~ 0 \leq i \}$$
$$\{ 0^n 1^m 0^n ~|~n,m \geq 0\}$$
$$\{ w \in \{0,1\}^* ~|~w = w^{\mathcal{R}}\}$$
$$\{ w w^{\mathcal{R}} ~|~ w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$$
\end{center}
\end{multicols}
Modify one of these sets in some way and use the Pumping Lemma to prove that the resulting set is still nonregular.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 4 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\textbf{Regular and nonregular languages} (12 points):
In Week 2's review quiz, we saw the definition that a set $X$ is said to be 
{\bf closed under an operation} if, for any elements in
$X$, applying to them gives an element in $X$. For example, the set of
integers is closed under multiplication because if we take any two
integers, their product is also an integer .

Recall the definitions of operations we've talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, 
we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]
Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for any sets $X$ and $Y$
\[
X \cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}
\]
\[
X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y \}
\]

\begin{enumerate} 
   \item \gradeCorrect Use the general constructions that we developed
   to prove the closure of the class of regular languages under various operations to produce the state diagram of a NFA that recognizes the language
   \[
   (~SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})~)^*
   \]
   {\it Hint: Question 4 from Homework 2 might be helpful.}
   
    For full credit, submit (1) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes $\{0,01,111\}$, (2) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes $SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})$, and (3) a state diagram of an NFA that recognizes $(~SUBSTRING(\{0, 01, 111\})~)^*$, and a brief justification of each state diagram that 
    references the language being recognized or the general constructions being used.

   \item \gradeComplete Prove that the class of nonregular languages over $\{0,1\}$ is not closed under the $SUBSTRING$ operation by giving an example 
   language $A$ that is nonregular but for which $SUBSTRING(A)$ is regular.
   A complete solution will give 
   (1) a clear and precise
   description of the language, (2) a justification for why it is nonregular (either by proving this directly or by referring to specific examples from the class or textbook), (3) a description of the result of applying the 
   $SUBSTRING$ operation to the language, and  (4) a justification for
   why this resulting language is regular.

   \item  \gradeCorrect Prove that the class of nonregular languages over $\{0,1\}$ is not closed under the $EXTEND$ operation by giving an example 
   language $B$ that is nonregular but for which $EXTEND(B)$ is regular.
   A complete solution will give 
   (1) a clear and precise
   description of the language, (2) a justification for why it is nonregular (either by proving this directly or by referring to specific examples from the class or textbook), (3) a description of the result of applying the 
   $EXTEND$ operation to the language, and  (4) a justification for
   why this resulting language is regular.

   \item \gradeComplete   Prove that the class of nonregular languages over $\{0,1\}$ is not closed under the Kleene star operation by giving an example 
   language $C$ that is nonregular but for which $C^*$ is regular.
   A complete solution will give 
   (1) a clear and precise
   description of the language, (2) a justification for why it is nonregular (either by proving this directly or by referring to specific examples from the class or textbook), (3) a description of the result of applying the 
   Kleene star operation to the language, and  (4) a justification for
   why this resulting language is regular.

\item \textbf{Regular and nonregular languages and Push-down automata (PDA)} (6 points): 
On page 7 of the week 4 notes, we have the following list of languages over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\{a^nb^n \mid 0  \leq n  \leq 5 \}$
    &$\{b^n a^n \mid  n  \geq 2\}$
    &$\{a^m b^n \mid  0 \leq m\leq n\}$
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
    $\{a^m b^n \mid  m \geq n+3,  n \geq 0\}$
    &$\{b^m a^n \mid  m \geq 1, n \geq  3\}$\\
    $\{ w  \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w = w^\mathcal{R} \}$
    &$\{ ww^\mathcal{R} \mid w\in \{a,b\}^* \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Pick one of the regular languages and design a regular expression that describes it and a DFA that recognizes it. 
    Briefly justify your regular expression by connecting
    the subexpressions of it to the intended language and referencing relevant definitions. Briefly justify your DFA design by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, 
    as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

    your PDA. Briefly justify your design by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, 
    as well as a brief
