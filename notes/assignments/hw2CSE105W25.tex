\item\textbf{Finite automata} (10 points):
Consider the finite automaton $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ whose state diagram is depicted below
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
\tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=none]

\node[initial,state] (q0)          {$q_0$};
\node[state,accepting]         (q1) [above right of=q0, xshift=20pt] {$q_1$};
\node[state]         (q2) [right of=q1, xshift=20pt] {$q_2$};

\end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst Write the formal definition of this automaton. In other words, give the five defining paramaters $Q$, $\Sigma$, $\delta$, $q_0$, $F$ so that they are consistent with the state diagram of $M$.

    \item\gradeCorrectFirst Give a regular expression $R$ so that $L(R) = L(M)$. In other words, we want a regular expression that describes the language 
    recognized by this finite automaton. Justify your answer by referring to the 
    definition of the semantics of regular expressions and computations of finite automata. 
    Include an explanation for why each string in $L(R)$ is accepted by the finite automaton {\it and}
    for why each string not in $L(R)$ is rejected by the finite automaton.

    {\it Ungraded bonus: can you find more than one such regular expression?}

    \item\gradeComplete Keeping the same set of states $Q$, 
    input alphabet $\Sigma$, 
    same start state $q_0$, and same transition 
    function $\delta$, choose a new set of accepting states $F_{new1}$ so that the new 
    finite automaton $M_1 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_{new1})$ that results 
    recognizes a {\bf proper superset} of $L(M)$, or explain 
    why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your choice of $F_{new1}$
    {\it and} a precise and clear explanation of why every string that is accepted by 
    $M$ is also accepted by $M_1$ {\it and} an example of a string that is accepted by $M_1$ and is rejected by $M$; or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    finite automaton $M_2 = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F_{new2})$ that results 
    recognizes a {\bf nonempty proper subset} of $L(M)$, or explain 
    why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your choice of $F_{new2}$
    {\it and} an example string accepted by $M_2$ {\it and} a precise and clear explanation of why every string that is accepted by

    %%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item \textbf{Automata design} (12 points):
As background to this question, recall that integers can be represented using base $b$ expansions, for 
any convenient choice of base $b$. The precise definition is:
for $b$ an integer greater than $1$ and $n$ a positive integer, 
the {\bf base $b$ expansion of $n$}  is defined to be
\[
(a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b
\]
where $k$ is a positive integer, $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{k-1}$ 
are nonnegative integers less than $b$, $a_{k-1} \neq  0$, and
\[
n =  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i} b^{i}
\]

Notice: {\it The base $b$ expansion of a positive integer $n$ is a string over the alphabet 
$\{x \in \mathbb{Z} \st 0 \leq x < b\}$
whose leftmost character is nonzero.}

An important property of base $b$ expansions of integers is that, for each integer $b$ greater than $1$,
each positive integer $n = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0)_b$, and each nonnegative integer $a$ less than $b$, 
\[
    bn + a = (a_{k-1} \cdots a_1 a_0a)_b
\]
In other words, shifting the base $b$ expansion to the left results in multiplying the integer value by the base.
In this question we'll explore building deterministic finite automata that recognize 
languages that correspond to useful sets of integers.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Design a DFA that recognizes the set of binary (base $2$) expansions of 
    positive integers that are powers of $2$. A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

    {\it Hints}: (1) A power of $2$ is an integer $x$ that can be written as $2^y$ for some nonnegative integer $y$, 
    (2) the DFA should accept the strings $100$, $10$ and $100000$ and should reject the 
    strings $010$, $1101$, and $\varepsilon$ (can you see why?).

    \item\gradeCorrect Design a DFA that recognizes the set of 
    binary (base $2$) expansions of positive integers that are less than $10$. Your DFA must use {\bf fewer than ten states}. 
    A complete solution will include the state diagram of your DFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction by explaining the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

    \item \gradeComplete Find a positive integer $B$ greater than $1$ so that 
    there is a DFA that recognizes the set of 
    base $B$ expansions of positive integers that are less than $10$ and it 
    uses as few states as possible. A complete solution will include the state 
    diagram of your DFA and 
    a brief justification of your choice of base.
        

    {\it Hint: sometimes rewriting the defining membership condition for a set in different ways helps us find alternate representations of that set.}

\item \textbf{Nondeterminism} (15 points): For this question, the alphabet is $\{a,b,c\}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\gradeComplete Design a NFA that recognizes the language
    \[ 
    L_1 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w \text{ starts with $a$ {\bf and} ends with $a$}\}
    \]

    A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction that explains the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

\item\gradeCorrect Design a NFA that recognizes the language 
    \[ 
    L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w \text{ has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
    \]
    For example, the empty string, $a$, $bac$, and $abca$ are each elements of this language but $aa$ and $abb$ and $abbc$ are not elements of this language.

    A complete solution will include the state diagram of your NFA and 
    a brief justification 
    of your construction that explains the role each state plays in the machine, as well as a brief 
    justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the specified language.

\item\gradeComplete Consider the language
\begin{align*}
L_1 \cup L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w &\text{ starts with $a$ and ends with $a$} \\
&\text{{\bf or} has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
\end{align*}
Give at least two representations of this language among the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item A regular expression that describes $L_1 \cup L_2$
\item A DFA that recognizes $L_1 \cup L_2$
\item A NFA that recognizes $L_1 \cup L_2$
\end{itemize}

You can design your automata directly or use the constructions from class and chapter 1 in the book to build these automata from automata for the simpler languages.
    
A complete solution will include at least two of the representations
as well as  a brief justification of each construction.


\item\gradeComplete Consider the language
    \begin{align*}
    L_1 \cap L_2 = \{w \in \{a,b,c\}^* \mid w &\text{ starts with $a$ and ends with $a$} \\
    &\text{{\bf and} has no consecutive repeated characters}\}
    \end{align*}
    Give at least two representations of this language among the following: 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A regular expression that describes $L_1 \cap L_2$
    \item A DFA that recognizes $L_1 \cap L_2$
    \item A NFA that recognizes $L_1 \cap L_2$
    \end{itemize}
    You can design your automata directly or use the constructions from class and chapter 1 in the book to build these automata from automata for the simpler languages.
    
A complete solution will include at least two of the representations
as well as  a brief justification of each construction.

\item\textbf{General constructions} (13 points):
In this question, you'll practice working with formal general constructions
for automata and translating between state diagrams and formal definitions.


Recall the definitions of operations we've talked about that produce
new languages from old: for each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, 
we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma^* \}
\]
Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for any sets $X$ and $Y$
\[
X \cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}
\]
\[
X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y \}
\]


Let $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ and 
$M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, q_2, F_2)$ be DFA.

For simplicity, assume that $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \emptyset$ and that 
$q_0 \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2$.

Consider the following definitions of new automata parameterized by 
these DFA:
\begin{itemize}
\item The NFA $N_\alpha = ( Q_1 \cup Q_2 \cup \{q_0\}, \Sigma, \delta_\alpha, q_0, F_1 \cup F_2)$ with the transition function given by 
\[
\delta_\alpha ( ~(q,x)~) = \begin{cases}
\{q_1, q_2\} &\text{if $q = q_0$, $x = \varepsilon$} \\
\emptyset &\text{if $q=q_0$, $x\in \Sigma$}\\
\{\delta_{1}(~(q,x)~)\} &\text{if $q\in Q_1$, $x\in \Sigma$}\\
\{\delta_{2}(~(q,x)~)\} &\text{if $q\in Q_2$, $x\in \Sigma$}\\
\emptyset &\text{if $q \in Q_1 \cup Q_2$, $x = \varepsilon$} \\
\end{cases}
\]
\item The NFA $N_\beta = ( Q_1 \times Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_\beta, (q_1,q_2), F_1 \times F_2)$  with the transition function given by 
\[
\delta(~(~(r,s)~, x~)~) = \{ (~\delta_{1}(~(r,x)~), \delta_{2}( ~(s,x)~)~)\}
\]
 and 
\[
\delta(~(~(r,s)~, \varepsilon~)~) = \emptyset
\]
for $r \in Q_1, s \in Q_2, x \in \Sigma$.
\item The NFA $N_{\gamma}=(Q_1\cup\{q_{0}\},\Sigma,\delta_{\gamma},q_{0},\{q \in Q_1 \mid \exists w \in \Sigma^* (\delta_1^* ((q,w)) \in F_1)\})$, and
        \[
            \delta_{\gamma} ((q,a)) = \begin{cases}
                \{\delta_1((q,a))\} &\text{if $q \in Q_1$, $a \in \Sigma$} \\
                \{q' \in Q_1 \mid \exists w \in \Sigma^* (\delta_1^*((q_1,w)) = q') \}&\text{if $q =q_{0}$, $a = \varepsilon$}\\
                \emptyset &\text{if $q = q_{0}$, $a \in \Sigma$} \\
                \emptyset &\text{if $q \in Q_1$, $a = \varepsilon$}
            \end{cases}
        \]

{\it Hint: the notation $\delta_1^*$ refers to the iterated transition function.}

justification about how the strings accepted and rejected by the machine connect to the language.

\item \gradeComplete If possible, associate each construction above with one of the operations whose definitions we recalled at the start of the question.  For example, is it the case that (for all choices of DFA $M_1$ and $M_2$) $L(N_\alpha) = L(M_1) \cup L(M_2)$? or $L(N_\alpha) = L(M_1) \cap L(M_2)$? etc.

A complete solution will consider each of the constructions $N_\alpha, N_\beta, N_\gamma$ in turn, and for each, either name the operation that's associated with the construction (and explain why) or explain why none of the operations mentioned is associated with the construction.
