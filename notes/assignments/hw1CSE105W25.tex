{\bf Assigned questions}


\begin{enumerate}[wide, labelwidth=!, labelindent=0pt]
%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 1 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\textbf{Strings and languages: finding examples and edge cases} (12 points):
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCompleteFirst  Give five (different) example alphabets that are meaningful or useful to you in some way. Specify them formally, either with 
    roster notation (which means listing all and only distict elements between $\{$ and $\}$ and separated by commas) or with another approach to precisely define all and only the elements of the alphabet.

    \item\gradeComplete Give an example of a finite set over an alphabet  and an infinite set over an alphabet. You get to choose the alphabet, and you get to choose the sets.  The goal is to practice communicating your choices and definitions with clear and precise notation. One habit that will be useful (for this course, and beyond), is to think of your response for each question as a well-formed paragraph: include all the information that is relevant so that your solution is self-contained, and so that each sentence is grammatically constructed.
    
    \item\gradeCorrectFirst Define an alphabet $\Sigma_1$ and an alphabet $\Sigma_2$ and a language $L_1$ over $\Sigma_1$ that is also a language over $\Sigma_2$ and a language $L_2$ over $\Sigma_2$ that is {\bf not} a language over $\Sigma_1$. 
    A complete and correct answer will use clear and precise notation
    (consistent with the textbook and class notes) and will include a description of why the given example $L_1$
    is a language over both $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ and a description 
    of why the given example $L_2$ is a language over $\Sigma_2$ and not over $\Sigma_1$.

    \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\textbf{Regular expressions} (20) points):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete  Give three regular expressions that all describe the set of all strings over $\{a,b\}$ that have 
    odd length. Ungraded bonus challenge: Make the expressions as different as possible!

    \item\gradeComplete  A friend tells you that each regular expression that has a Kleene star ($~^*$) describes an
    infinite language. Are they right? Either help them justify their claim or give a counterexample to disprove it
    and explain your counterexample.

    \item\gradeCorrect For this question, the alphabet is $\{a,b,c\}$. A friend is trying to design a regular expression that describes the set of all strings over this alphabet that end in $c$. Classify each of the following attempts as 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Correct. Explain why.
    \item Error Type 1: Incorrect, because (even though each string that is in the language described by the regular expression ends in $c$) there is a string that ends in $c$ that is not in the language described by the regular expression. Give this example string and explain why it proves we're in this case. 
    \item Error Type 2: Incorrect, because (even though each string that ends in $c$ is in the language described by the regular expression), there is a string in the language described by the regular expression that does not end in $c$. Give this example string and explain why it proves we're in this case. 
    \item Error Type 3: Incorrect, because there are two counterexample strings, one which is a string that ends in $c$ that is not in the language described by the regular expression and one which is in the language described by the regular expression but does not end in $c$.Give both example strings and describe why each has the given property.
    \end{itemize}

    \hrule
    {\it Worked example for reference:} Consider the regular expression $(a\cup b\cup c)^*$. This regular expression has {\bf Error Type 2} because it describes the set of all strings over $\{a,b,c\}$, so even though each string that ends in $c$ is in this language, there is an example, say $ab$ that is a string in the language described by the regular expression (because we consider the string formed as a result of the Kleene star operation which has 2 slots and where the first slot matches the $a$ in $a \cup b \cup c$ and the second slot matches $b$ in $a \cup b \cup c$) but does not end in $c$ (it ends in $b$).
    \hrule
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The regular expression is   
        \[
        (a\cup b)^* \circ c
        \]
        \item The regular expression is  
        \[
        (a \circ b \circ c)^*
        \]
        \item The regular expression is  
        \[
        a^*c ~\cup~ b^*c ~\cup~ c^*c
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 3 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\textbf{Functions over languages} (18 points):

For each language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$, we have the 
associated sets of strings (also over $\Sigma$)
\[
    L^* = \{ w_1 \cdots w_k \mid k \geq 0 \textrm{ and each } w_i \in L\}
\]
and
\[
    SUBSTRING(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ \text{there exist } x,y \in \Sigma_1^* \text{ such that } xwy \in L\}
\]
and 
\[
    EXTEND(L) = \{ w \in \Sigma_1^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L \text{ and } v \in \Sigma_1^* \}
\]
Also, recall the set operations union and intersection: for any sets $X$ and $Y$
\[
X \cup Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ or } w \in Y \}
\]
\[
X \cap Y = \{ w \mid w \in X \text{ and } w \in Y \}
\]

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeComplete Specify an example language $A$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$SUBSTRING(A) = EXTEND(A)$$
    or explain why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $A$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $SUBSTRING(A)$, $EXTEND(A)$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set equality,
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example language $B$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$SUBSTRING(B) \cap EXTEND(B) = \{\varepsilon\}$$ and $$SUBSTRING(B) \cup EXTEND(B) = \{0,1\}^*$$
    or explain why there is no such example. 
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $B$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $SUBSTRING(B)$, $EXTEND(B)$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set equality with 
    $\{\varepsilon\}$ and $\{0,1\}^*$ (respectively), or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

    \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example {\bf infinite} language $C$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$SUBSTRING(C) \neq \{0,1\}^*$$ and $$SUBSTRING(C) = C^*$$or 
    explain why there is no such example.
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $C$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $SUBSTRING(C)$, $C^*$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims, 
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.


    \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example {\bf finite} language $D$ over $\{0,1\}$ such that 
    $$EXTEND(D) \neq \{0,1\}^*$$ and $$EXTEND(D) = D^*$$or 
    explain why there is no such example.
    A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and
    clear description of your example language $D$ 
    and a precise and clear description of
    the result of computing $EXTEND(D)$, $D^*$ (using the given definitions)
    to justify this description and to justify the set nonequality claims, 
    or (2) a sufficiently general and correct argument
    why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.
