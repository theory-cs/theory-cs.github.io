\item \textbf{Regular and nonregular languages and context-free grammars (CFG)} (6 points): 
On page 7 of the week 4 notes, we have the following list of languages over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    $\{a^nb^n \mid 0  \leq n  \leq 5 \}$
    &$\{b^n a^n \mid  n  \geq 2\}$
    &$\{a^m b^n \mid  0 \leq m\leq n\}$
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
    $\{a^m b^n \mid  m \geq n+3,  n \geq 0\}$
    &$\{b^m a^n \mid  m \geq 1, n \geq  3\}$\\
    $\{ w  \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w = w^\mathcal{R} \}$
    &$\{ ww^\mathcal{R} \mid w\in \{a,b\}^* \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}

    Briefly justify your grammar by describing the role of each of the rules
    and connecting it to the intended language and referencing relevant definitions.
    \item\gradeComplete Pick one of the nonregular languages and design a context-free grammar that generates it.  Briefly justify your grammar by describing the role of each of the rules
    and connecting it to the intended language and referencing relevant definitions.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 2 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item \textbf{General constructions for context-free languages} (15 points):

In class in week 5, we described several general constructions 
with PDAs and CFGs, leaving their details to
homework. In this question, we'll fill in these details. The first constructions
help us prove that the class of regular languages is a subset of the
class of context-free languages. The other construction allows us 
to make simplifying assumptions about PDAs recognizing languages.

\begin{enumerate}

\item\gradeComplete When we first introduced PDAs we observed 
that any NFA can be transformed to a PDA by not using the stack 
of the PDA at all. Suppose a friend gives you the following construction
to formalize this transformation:

\begin{quote}
Given a NFA $N = (Q, \Sigma, \delta_N, q_0, F)$ we define a PDA $M$
with $L(M) = L(N)$ by letting $M = ( Q, \Sigma, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where 
$\delta(~(q,a,b)~) = \delta_N(~(q,a)~)$ for each $q \in Q$, 
$a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$ and $b \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$.
\end{quote}

For each of the six defining parameters for the PDA, explain whether 
it's defined correctly or not. If it is not defined correctly, 
explain why not and give a new definition for this parameter that 
corrects the mistake.

\item\gradeCorrectFirst In the book on page 107, the top paragraph describes a procedure for converting DFAs to CFGs:
\begin{quote}
   You can convert any DFA into an equivalent CFG as follows. 
   Make a variable $R_i$ for each state $q_i$ of the DFA. Add the rule $R_i \to aR_j$ to the
   CFG if $\delta(q_i,a) =q_j$ is a transition in the DFA. Add the rule
   $R_i\to \varepsilon$ if $q_i$ is an accept state of the DFA. Make $R_0$ the start variable ofthe grammar, 
   where $q_0$ is the start state of the machine. Verify on your own that the resulting CFG 
   generates the same language that the DFA recognizes.
\end{quote}

Use this construction to get a context-free grammar generating the language 
\[
    \{ w \in \{a,b\}^* \mid w \text{ has at least one $a$ and does not end in  $bb$}\}
\]
by (1) designing a DFA that recognizes this language and then (2) applying the construction from the book to convert the 
DFA to an equivalent CFG. A complete and correct submission will include the state diagram of the DFA, a brief justification of why 
it recognizes the language, and then the complete and precise definition of the CFG that results from applying the construction 
from the book to this DFA. {\it Ungraded bonus: take a sample string in the language and see how the computation of 
the DFA on this string translates to a derivation in your grammar.}

\item Let $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \Gamma_1, \delta_1, q_1, F_1)$ 
be a PDA and let $q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}$ be three fresh state labels 
(i.e. $Q_1 \cap \{q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}\} = \emptyset$) 
and let $\#$ be a fresh stack symbol (i.e. $\# \notin \Gamma_1$).
We define the PDA $M_2$ as
\[
   (Q_2, \Sigma, \Gamma_2, \delta_2, q_{new}, \{s_{new}\})
\]
with $Q_2 = Q_1 \cup \{q_{new}, r_{new}, s_{new}\}$ 
and $\Gamma_2 = \Gamma_1 \cup \{\#\}$
and 
$\delta_2 : Q_2 \times \Sigma_\varepsilon \times {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon \to 
\mathcal{P}(Q_2 \times {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon)$ given by 
\[
\delta_2 ( ~(q,a,b)~) = 
\begin{cases}
\{(q_1, \#)\} &\text{if } q = q_{new}, a = \varepsilon, b = \varepsilon\\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) &\text{if } q\in Q_1 \setminus F_1, a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}, b \in {\Gamma_1}_\varepsilon \\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) &\text{if } q\in F_1, a \in \Sigma, b \in {\Gamma_1}_\varepsilon \\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) &\text{if } q\in F_1, a =\varepsilon, b \in {\Gamma_1} \\
\delta_1( ~(q,a,b)~) \cup \{(r_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &\text{if } q\in F_1, a =\varepsilon, b =\varepsilon \\
\{(r_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &\text{if } q = r_{new}, a =\varepsilon, b \in \Gamma_{1} \\
\{(s_{new}, \varepsilon)\} &\text{if } q= r_{new}, a = \varepsilon, b = \#\\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
for each $q \in Q_2$, $a \in \Sigma_{\varepsilon}$, 
and $b \in {\Gamma_2}_\varepsilon$.

In this question, we'll apply this construction for a specific PDA and 
use this example to extrapolate the effect of this construction.
\begin{enumerate}

\item\gradeCorrect Consider the PDA $M_1$ with input alphabet $\{0,1\}$ 
and stack alphabet $\{0,1, \$\}$ whose state diagram is

\begin{center}

   \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
      \tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=none]
    
    \node[initial,state] (s1)          {$s_1$};
    \node[state] (s2) [right of=s1, xshift=20pt]  {$s_2$};
    \node[state] (s3) [right of=s2, xshift=20pt]  {$s_3$};
    \node[state] (s4) [right of=s3, xshift=20pt]  {$s_4$};
    \node[state, accepting] (s5)  [right of=s4, xshift=20pt]         {$s_5$};

    \path (s1) edge  [bend left=0] node {$\varepsilon,\varepsilon; \$$} (s2)
    (s2) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$1,\varepsilon; 0$} (s2)
    (s2) edge  [bend left=0] node {$\varepsilon,\varepsilon; \varepsilon$} (s3)
    (s3) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$0,0; \varepsilon$} (s3)
    (s3) edge  [bend left=0] node {$0,\$; 0$} (s4)
    (s4) edge  [bend left=0] node {$0,\varepsilon; 0$} (s5)
    ;
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Draw the state diagram for the PDA $M_2$ that results from applying 
the construction to $M_1$. Also, give an example string of length $5$ 
that is accepted by both $M_1$ and $M_2$ and justify your choice by describing 
an accepting computation for each of the PDAs on your input string.

\item\gradeComplete Compare $L(M_1)$ and $L(M_2)$. Are these sets 
equal? Does your answer depend on the specific choice of $M_1$? Why or why not?

\item\gradeComplete Consider the PDA $N$ with input alphabet $\{0,1\}$ and
stack alphabet $\{0,1\}$ whose state diagram is 

\begin{center}
   \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt, auto, node distance=2cm, semithick]
      \tikzstyle{every state}=[text=black, fill=none]
    
    \node[initial,state, accepting] (q1)          {$q_1$};
    \node[state, accepting]         (q2) [right of=q1, xshift=20pt] {$q_2$};
    
    \path (q1) edge  [loop above, near start] node {$0,\varepsilon; 0$} (q1)
        (q1) edge [bend left=0] node {$1,0;\varepsilon$} (q2)
        (q2) edge [loop above, near start] node {$1,0;\varepsilon$} (q2)
    ;
    \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

   Remember that the definition of set-wise concatenation is:
    for languages $L_1, L_2$ over the alphabet $\Sigma$, we have the 
    associated set of strings
    \[
       L_1 \circ L_2 = \{ w \in \Sigma^* ~|~ w = uv \text{ for some strings } u \in L_1 \text{ and } v \in L_2 \}
    \]
    In class, we discussed how extrapolating the construction that we used to prove that the class of regular languages
    is closed under set-wise concatenation by drawing 
    spontaneous transitions from the accepting states in the first 
    machine to the start state of the second machine doesn't work.
    Use the example of $M_1$ and $N$ to prove this by showing that
    \[
    L(M_1) \circ L(N)
    \]
    is {\bf not} the language recognized by the machine 
    results from taking the two machines
    $M_1$ and $N$, setting the start state of $M_1$ to be the start state of 
    the new machine, setting the set of accepting states of $N$ to be
    the set of accepting states of the new machine, and drawing spontaneous 
    arrows from the accepting states
    of $M_1$ to the start state of $N$.
    Then, describe the language recognized by the machine 
    that results from taking the two machines
    $M_2$ and $N$, setting the start state of $M_2$ to be the start state of 
    the new machine, setting the set of accepting states of $N$ to be
    the set of accepting states of the new machine, and drawing spontaneous 
    arrows from the accepting states
    of $M_2$ to the start state of $N$. Use this description 
    to explain why we used the construction of $M_2$ from $M_1$
    and how this construction could be used in a proof of the 
    closure of the class of context-free languages under set-wise concatenation.

    A complete response will give an example string that witnesses that $L(M_1) \circ L(N)$ is not equal to the language recognized by the PDA resulting from the wrong construction (described above) {\bf and} the state diagram 
    of the PDA that results from applying that construction to $M_2$ and $N$ (instead of $M_1$), with a brief justification about why that approach works.

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example string $w_1$ of length $4$ over 
        $\Sigma$ that is {\bf accepted} by this Turing machine, or explain why there is no such 
        example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear 
        description of your example  string and a precise and clear description of the accepting computation
        of the Turing machine on this string or (2) a sufficiently
        general and correct argument why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.
        
        To describe a computation of a Turing machine, include the contents of the 
        tape, the state of the machine, and the location of the read/write head at each step in the computation.
        
        {\it Hint:} In class we've drawn pictures to represent the configuration of the machine at each step 
        in a computation.  You may do so or you may choose to describe these configurations in words.
        
        \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example string $w_2$ of length $3$ over $\Sigma$ 
        that is {\bf rejected} by this Turing machine
        or explain why there is no such 
        example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear 
        description of your example  string and a precise and clear description of the rejecting computation
        of the Turing machine on this string or (2) a sufficiently
        general and correct argument why there is no such example, referring back to the relevant definitions.

        \item\gradeCorrect Specify an example string $w_3$ of length $3$ over $\Sigma$

        or explain why there is no such 
        example. A complete solution will include either (1) a precise and clear

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 4 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\textbf{Implementation-level descriptions of deciders and recognizers} (12 points): Consider the language $$\{a^i b^j \mid i \geq 0, j > 1\}$$
over the alphabet $\{a,b\}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]\gradeCorrect Give an example of a Turing machine that {\bf decides} this language.
A complete solution will include  {\bf both} a state diagram and an implementation-level description 
of this Turing machine, along with a brief explanation of why it recognizes this language, and why it is a decider.

\item[(b)]\gradeCorrect Give an example of a Turing machine that {\bf recognizes but does not decide} this language.
A complete solution will include  {\bf both} a state diagram and an implementation-level description 
of this Turing machine, along with a brief explanation of why it recognizes this language, and why it is not a decider.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%% PROBLEM 5 %%%%%%%%%%%
\item\textbf{Classifying languages} (8 points):
Our first example of a more complicated Turing machine was of a Turing machine 
that recognized the language $\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}$ 
(Figure 3.10 in the textbook), which we 
know is not context-free. Let's call that Turing machine $M_0$. The language
\[
    L = \{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}
\]
is also not context-free. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item\gradeCorrect Choose an example string of length $2$ in $L$ that is in {\bf not} in $\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}$ and describe the computation of the Turing machine $M_0$ on your example string. 
    Include the contents of the  tape, the state of the machine, and the location of the read/write head at each step in the computation.
    \item\gradeComplete Explain why the Turing machine from the textbook 
    and class that recognized $\{w \# w \mid w \in\{0,1\}^*\}$ does 
    not recognize $\{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$. Use your example to explain why $M_0$ doesn't recognize $L$.
    \item\gradeComplete Explain how you would change $M_0$ to get a 
    new Turing machine that does recognize $L$. Describe this new Turing machine using both an implementation-level definition and a state diagram of the Turing machine. You may use all 
    our usual conventions for state diagrams of Turing machines 
    (we do not include the node for the reject state $qrej$ and any missing transitions 
    in the state diagram have value $(qrej,\square,R)$; 
    $b \to R$ label means $b \to b, R$ ).
